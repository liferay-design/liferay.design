_A foundational piece of [organizational culture](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/importance-of-organization-culture.htm) is shared values — Liferay’s core values are fairly recently published[^1] and for them to take root and be effective, they need to be [woven into everything](https://hbr.org/2002/07/make-your-values-mean-something)._

_As we discussed the core skills that we want to see in the Design Department, we asked ourselves how do our company values shape the way we work? How are they manifested in our evaluations and growth? How do we advance and promote these values?_

_While Liferay’s Core Values don’t map 1:1 with traditional Design skills, there are commonalities we wanted to articulate in order to contribute to the maturation of Liferay’s Core Values and the legitimization of our department’s core skills._

| Liferay Core Values                                                                                                                                                                              | Transversal Skills                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Produce Excellence** <br/> We give our best efforts to get excellent results that stand in the market. But the process is also important: we won't betray our values just to get the job done. | **Excellence** <br/> Achieving a high level of customer[^2] value without compromising [our principles](/principles).                                                        |
| **Lead by Serving** <br/> Leadership is a calling to serve others and stay humble. Our people lead by example, regardless of position or title.                                                  | **Influence** <br/> Telling people what to do is easy — uncovering people’s talents and inspiring them to do something better than you could have imagined — is not so easy. |
| **Value People** <br/> People are inherently valuable. Therefore, we respect people, invest in relationships, and celebrate one another.                                                         | **Collaboration** <br/> Effectively involving the right people, synthesizing insights and expertise.                                                                         |
| **Grow & Get Better** <br/> It's not about being better than someone else, but being better than you were yesterday. We seek to learn and grow from every single experience.                     | **Impact** <br/> Beyond "making it pretty" — good design impacts the bottom line. Difficult to measure at times, but there nonetheless.                                      |
| **Stay Nerdy** <br/>We enjoy the unique personalities that we have at Liferay. We encourage our people to share their interests, have fun, and be comfortable being themselves.                  | **Advocacy** <br/> Successful Designers are often very passionate people. Sharing expertise, resources, thoughts, feelings, emotions is second nature.                       |
