<div class="page-description">Header is a toolbar that provides identification and lets the user navigate and perform actions.</div>

### Usage

Header is always fixed to the top of the window.

The Header is used on almost every page in the system. The most common configuration is shown below:
* Left area: Used for actions such as triggering the side menu and back navigation
* Center area: Used for the page or application title and help
* Right area: Used for actions. These are identified with an icon when possible and listed inside a kebab menu when an icon is not clear.
    * These actions are application level actions

The Header can have different configurations, as you can see in the examples below.


### Examples

#### Application header

The application title always appears in the header (Web Content in this example). The title remains in the header until the user navigates to a detail page or the user has finished configuring the asset. Related actions for the application may appear on the right side.

#### Asset or element detail page header

The asset or element title appears in the header. A back button is provided to navigate to the asset/element location in the application. Related actions for the asset/element may appear on the right side.
