## Summary

-   **Approval-only** for EVERYTHING
-   **Curved text** for Speaker information
-   **Square layouts** for Instagram and WhatsApp
-   **Illustration-centric designs **(via [Blueprints](https://liferay.design/blueprints/resources/illustrations/))

## Full Update

**[2021 Liferay General](https://app.easil.com/designs/catalogue/folders?folderId=36f0bb58-d4c9-493e-aee4-076bd984c14d&categoryId=All)** templates are now available for your use! The updated designs are more aligned to the look and feel of LRDC, and they will replace the ones in the **2019 Liferay** folder (which will be archived). Like before, you can use these for anything that requires our general corporate style (i.e., is not event- or campaign-specific).

### What‚Äôs New

#### ALL templates are now Approval-only

You no longer need to download and post a draft of your design for approval in [#com-des-easil](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95)! Instead, please submit a request for approval within the Easil app, then ping the channel as you‚Äôve already been doing for event and campaign assets. For more info, see _Submitting Designs for Approval (non-Brand Manager roles)_ in this [article](https://about.easil.com/submit-designs-for-approval/).

#### Curved Text

A handful of our new designs have curved text ([see examples here](https://about.easil.com/23-ways-to-use-curved-text/)). Most of the styling has already been set and locked, so you‚Äôll only be able to edit the copy. When you click into the text field, select all, then paste in or type your own copy. The text will auto-size based on amount; if it looks too large or small, no worries! Just include a note about sizing when you request approval and our team will adjust it for you.

#### Instagram / WhatsApp (IG / WA) sizing

In addition to the current Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Pardot sizes, we are now offering square 1080x1080 px templates for use in Instagram and WhatsApp.

![alt_text](images/image1.png#width=49%; 'image_tooltip') ![alt_text](images/image10.png#width=49%; 'image_tooltip')

#### Illustrations

Since you all have access to [beautiful illustrations](/blueprints/resources/illustrations/), we wanted to make templates showcasing them. Simply download your desired illustration, then upload and add it to any template that has ‚Äúillustration‚Äù as a tag or in the filename. Generally speaking, spot illustrations will work better than hero ones.

![alt_text](images/image7.png 'image_tooltip')

![alt_text](images/image4.png 'image_tooltip')

#### Light/Dark Options

Since it‚Äôs not always possible to convert logos to white PNG‚Äôs, we‚Äôve added a number of light-background options to the folder. There‚Äôs no specific rule about when to use dark vs. light, but you should consider what would contrast well in the UI of the social media platform or email you‚Äôll be posting in.

Other features, such as adding a co-branded logo or replacing photos, remain the same as before. Many of you are Easil masters by now, so this stuff should be easy-peasy. :)

If you have any questions, please search [#com-des-easil](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95) ‚Äî or ask in the channel.

As always, happy Easil-ing! :)

Pro Tip: If you want to match the colors of your Easil graphic with elements on a corresponding landing page or email banner, you can use [this online eyedropper tool](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en/) to get exact hex values.

If you've requested approval for an Easil design, please ping our team in [#com-des-easil](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95). We don't receive email notifications for approval requests, so this is the best and fastest way to let us know. Thanks!

_Read more about the newly added approval workflow [on Easil's website](https://about.easil.com/submit-designs-for-approval/)._

Please note:

-   Once you submit your design for approval, I'll be notified and can review it within the app. You won't be able to download the graphic until it is approved.

-   Once approved, you can locate your design in the "Approved Designs" tab on the right side of your workspace. At this point, you will only be able to download. You won't be able to make any additional changes without requesting another approval.

-   For the time being, we will not be implementing this process with every template--just the ones that require extra attention to details, like the Gartner campaign. (This may change pending further discussion.)

Please feel free to add comments and questions in [#com-des-easil](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95).

Thank you!

## Draft Sharing

Easil now has a draft-sharing function! This means you can share something in your Workspace for collaborative purposes, or to make a localization. Beware that two people working on one shared draft may lead to unsaved changes, so be sure to communicate with all collaborators first! You can access this feature from your Workspace, by clicking on the arrow icon at the bottom right of your design. See the :thread: :point_down::skin-tone-4: for a GIF demo.

## Black Box Preview Error

![alt_text](images/black-box-error.png 'image_tooltip')

Some of you have noticed that there's a black box around the Liferay logo in some of the templates. Unsightly as it is, please ignore, as it will NOT affect your final export. The display error is due to some of Easil's recent updates, and they are working on a solution.

If you have further questions about either announcement, feel free to ask in [#com-des-easil](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95).

Thanks!

## Pixelation

Easil was able to fix the white pixelation issues for speaker headshots, yay! Currently, Blue BG 1 has the updated mask, and I'm working on getting the others fixed as well in the next two weeks.

## Speaker templates

Along with the headshot update, a 2-Speaker format will soon be added to all templates that have Speaker Pages. :black_circle: :black_circle:

## Square Facebook templates

Square Facebook templates (1080 x 1080) are in the works and will be available shortly.

If you have any questions or comments, please share in [#com-des-easil](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95). Thanks!

# September 13, 2019

We've been seeing some of your Easil creations on social media. Some are looking [pretty snazzy](https://twitter.com/liferay_br/status/1161345372498927618), and others could use a [bit of tweaking](https://twitter.com/liferay_br/status/1164205573115658242/photo/1).
The main issue, however, is that we haven't seen ANY of these posts shared here. üòî

We wanted to remind you again that it is REQUIRED to link ALL of your published, Easil-made posts here in this channel (please refer [to our earlier post](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CM1HX3E95/p1565971172045400)). Yes, we do mean Every. Single. Published. Post.

Furthermore, failure to adhere to this important workflow policy could lead to a suspension of your account. We don't want to police the process unnecessarily, but it's all of our responsibility to uphold the Liferay brand across all platforms.

## Why is this step so crucial?

If we can't see what you're posting, we won't be able to refine the templates so that they're easier to use and actually work for your various use cases. :nerd_face:

If you don't get feedback on your post, you'll never know what design rules might've been broken or how you might be inadvertently weakening the Liferay brand. :scream:

Not to mention, this is a great opportunity to inspire and be inspired, and give and get high fives! üôå

So with all that said, please start sharing your links here as soon as possible. If we continue to see posts on social media that aren't shared here, we may start reaching out directly to you/your managers.

Thanks everyone!

It's been about a week since we launched Easil. I hope you've all gotten used to the app and are on your way to creating beautiful branded graphics!

Just wanted to remind you of Step 2 in the Marketing Workflow. After creating an Easil graphic and publishing it via social media or email, please post the published link here in this channel.

This will help inspire others as they see what's being created, and will give me a chance to provide feedback and adjust the templates (if needed).

_Note: It's not required that you get feedback/approval from me before posting, but if you're feeling unsure about your design, we're happy to provide feedback at any time._

Thanks and happy Easil-ing!

We've changed the setup process! We are now requiring everyone to go through the training course, take a short quiz, and get manager approval before receiving Easil access.
Please access the updated instructions at [/easil/introduction](/blueprints/easil/introduction).
