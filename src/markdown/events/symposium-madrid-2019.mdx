_This year's Symposium in Madrid was an extra-special event &mdash; in addition to celebrating Liferay's 15th anniversary, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of hosting our annual Symposium in Spain._

## The Venue

Customers, partners, developers, and other Liferayers from all over the world descended on Madrid for this two day event. We hosted everyone in the Goya Theater, an amazing event space in Madrid's Latina district, on the banks of the Manzanares river that winds through the southern end of the city.

Before I get too ahead of myself &mdash; a huge part of what made the event such a success, was the near countless hours put in by Marketers planning the event. Working closely with our Communication Designers to define everything down to the most minute detail.

[Rachel](/team/yuan-rachel) has been leading the design work for this Symposium for close to 5 years from our office in Los Angeles &mdash; this year we had [Marleny](/team/francisco-marleny) join our team in the nick of time. She assumed many of the duties this year, and did an amazing job.

## Should Designers Speak?

We believe it's very important that designers do things that make them uncomfortable &mdash; like speak in public. In our office here in Spain, the designers are an integral part of the product development team. As such, they deserve their share of the spotlight.

This year, we had two Product Designers share:

### Empowering Business Users to Create Websites

[Juan Anton](/team/anton-juan) and Jürgen Kappler, from Engineering, shared the stage in a riveting presentation, demonstrating the full power of Modern Site Building in Liferay 7.2.

### Optimizing Digital Experiences with A/B Testing

[Susana Vazquez](/team/vazquez-susana) (pictured at the beginning of the post) and her counterpart in Engineering, David Arqués, shared an exciting new feature that is part of our core product, but also ties [in our recent analytics offering](/articles/2019/is-now-the-right-time-for-redesign/).

## #2020Vision

This might be the first you've seen this hashtag, but I assure you it definitely won't be the last. After a few weeks of well-deserved rest, the Marketing team has already begun planning for next year's Symposium and we're all very excited to see them top this one!
