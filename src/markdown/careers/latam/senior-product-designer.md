## About This Position

Providing design services to our customers by applying design best practices in the EMEA region is a high priority for our business. We’re looking for a senior designer with agency experience that can serve our customers and partners while simultaneously growing our design culture and presence in the community. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and North America that are excited to build with you.
You’ll be working with sales and consulting teams, interfacing directly with prospects and customers along the complete software development lifecycle.

Sometimes you’ll work independently, guiding stakeholders along the entire design process from research and strategy to implementation, iterating along the way. Other times you'll work collaboratively with other designers to deliver the entire experience for customer projects.

Recent enterprise solutions this role has delivered for were customer and insurance agent portals, an employee intranet for a healthcare org, and a multi-site e-commerce solution for a major manufacturer.
