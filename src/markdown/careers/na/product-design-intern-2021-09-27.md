## Who Designs at Liferay?

Design is [a team sport](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/12-qualities-of-effective-design-organizations) — while our athletic accomplishments are limited, our commitment to building a strong team is not. We firmly believe in going far together — what this looks like is passion for producing excellence and a patient tenacity to make improvements over time.

To learn more about who you'd be working with, get acquainted with [the team](/team)!

## Who Are We Looking For?

A product design intern to add value to our design team and products. A person with a good visual and interaction design base, willing to learn and improve their skills and take them to the next level.

You will work in a multidisciplinary team alongside a design mentor who will be there every step of the way to help you grow. Besides your team, there are product teams working on different pieces of a global product roadmap. You will discuss and align your designs and interactions along with other product designers.

We care deeply about designing great experiences that solve real-world business problems, and we do it without sacrificing aesthetic standards.

### What will the 12 weeks include?

-   Redesigning or improving a specific product or feature.
-   Working closely with our design team, PMs, and engineering.
-   Workshops, a dedicated mentor, and 1:1s with our global design team.
-   Social events & professional development opportunities.
-   A project that you will be able to add to your portfolio.


### An ideal intern will have:

-   The ability to articulate what makes a good digital product.
-   Ability to understand & articulate product strategy at a high level.
-   Ability to demonstrate a complete design process.
-   Experience with design tools (we use Figma exclusively).
-   Proficient visual design skills in color, typography, layout, iconography.
-   Experience with desktop or mobile design (classroom experience is okay).
-   Curiosity and excitement about learning and growing as a designer.
-   Can attend in-person at our Diamond Bar office (required)

If you meet at least 50% of these listed points please apply! We don’t expect you to know everything on day one, we only ask that you be excited and willing to learn.

## How Do Liferay’s Core Values Look in the Design Team?

-   **Produce excellence** — we strive to become masters in our craft, doing the right thing even if no one notices.
-   **Lead by serving** — we’re all willing to do the unglamourous work and always looking for opportunities to help others.
-   **Value people** — we listen first and believe that everyone can contribute because there is strength in diversity.
-   **Grow and get better** — we’re always learning, when we find ways to improve our designs we take them, when we make mistakes we admit, apologize, and move forward. We fail a lot, but we aren’t failures because we learn and improve.
-   **Stay nerdy** — we live and breathe design, but we also have passions outside of work — rock climbing, coffee, photography, writing — and pursue them to the n-th degree.

## What Can We Offer You?

-   Be part of a great team and work with designers around the world.
-   Experience working in a company that has strong executive support for Design.
-   Supportive work environment that will set you on track to start your design career.
-   Opportunities to take responsibility and grow professionally. We like to Stay Nerdy!
