Growing as a designer should be very important for you as a designer. It is not only about opting to a better salary but about getting the right recognition according to your knowledge and experience.

## How to apply

There are two different ways of opting to a promotion:

* Manager suggestion: your manager thinks it is the right time for you to promote
* You feel you are ready. You have two possibilities:
    * Talk to your manager
    * Communicate your decision to another manager of same or upper level

As a designer who decides to promote to next level in your career path as individual contributor you will need to prepare a presentation to defend in front of the Evaluation Panel.

## When is the right time

You can opt to a promotion whenever you or your manager wants. 

## Key elements

### Presentation

In your presentation we expect to show and describe the kind of tasks that you were doing, what went right and wrong and what did your learn on the way. We expect you to communicate what made you a more mature designer. Why do you deserve a higher role in the company.

### Evaluation Panel

The evaluation panel will be your audience. This panel is comprised by your direct manager, and two or three other managers from the design department.


## The process

Once you are decided to promote and made it official through any of the aforementioned ways, the manager you contacted will let you know your presentation date. Please estimate that you will need around a month to properly prepare your presentation.

The presentation time will be around 30 minutes + 15-20 minutes for questions from the Evaluation Panel.

## The outcome

The Evaluation Panel will meet in the next 48h to take a decision about your promotion. The outcome of this meeting will be essentially the decision to promote you or not. 

Your manager will be in charged of communicating you

* The Evaluation Panel decision together with the new responsibities if it is the case.
* Your new OKRs to continue growing as a designer.
* Your new salary, if it is the case
