## CDO Chief Design Officer[^3]

The CDO is typically responsible for overseeing all design and innovation aspects of a company’s products and services.

1. Responsible for brand building and design-driven innovation inside Liferay
2. Understanding business as a whole — is key to driving their arguments forward.
3. Somebody who deeply understands the company, in every aspect. Somebody who understands the equity of the brand, the business model, how we develop products, how we drive innovation, what are the processes of the organization, what is the culture, from the world of finance to HR, design, marketing and so forth.
4. Anticipates the future direction of the industry using both research and own insight, and brings the company into the fore of that trajectory.

7. Represent design for the organization. The CDO is the primary voice of design inside and outside the company, sharing its work, evangelizing its success, articulating its vision. And sometimes this representation means fighting for design in the face of policies, procedures, and bureaucracy that limits the team’s potential.
8. Vision. Developing a “north star” for the company, and strategy across the company, is not a one-time act, but an ongoing process of refinement and evolution.
9. Living the culture. Addressed the culture of a design team is essential to its long-term success. A Director not only establishes the team’s cultural values but demonstrates them every day through their actions.
10. Chief Design Officer requires empathy, driven by curiosity to understand people beyond observation-only.
