### Usage

-   Only use this pattern for image selection.
-   The elements placed in the grid must be an image type that can support a thumbnail.
-   Simple and multiple selection must be possible.
    -   Selecting a single image closes the image selector modal.
    -   Multiple selection lets the user select as many images as they need. In this case, the modal is closed with the “Done” button.
-   Hovering an image displays its title. Long titles have ellipsis in the middle, while still displaying the end of the title so the user can quickly identify it.
    -   Image titles are always shown on touch interfaces.

On mobile devices, since there is no hover state, images must always display their title.
