### Events

Drag and drop interaction is composed of a series of six events:

![the 6 drag and drop events](/images/lexicon/DnDEvents.jpg)

* **DragStart:** An element starts to drag when it is clicked or Tapped on while holding and Moving the pointer.
* **Drag:** The element is being dragged.
* **DragLeave:** The element leaves its original position or a valid target.
* **DragEnter:** The element enters a valid drop target.
* **Drop:** The element is released.
* **DragEnd:** The element has completed the drag and drop interaction. It is successful if it matches the conditions for a drop target.

### Actors

The drag and drop interaction involves the following actors:

#### Pointer

Although a standard element, you must consider the type of mouse pointer you use during dragging and dropping. Please follow these guidelines:

| Type | Usage |
| --- | ---- |
| ![cursor pointer](/images/lexicon/CursorPointer.jpg) | **Default:** the standard mouse cursor. |
| ![cursor hand open](/images/lexicon/CursorHandOpen.jpg) | **Open hand:** used during the hover state of an element when it is possible to move it around, but selection is not allowed (e.g. a map or a zoomed image) |
| ![cursor hand closed](/images/lexicon/CursorHandClosed.jpg) | **Dragging:** always required as feedback for the dragging action when using a mouse |


#### Handler

It can be hard to distinguish a draggable element from a standard element in the interface. To properly communicate that an element is draggable to the user, we recommend that you use the drag-dots icon in the element on hover.

A good example is a list of draggable items:

#### Drag Element & Drag Feedback

Elements that are draggable must also offer feedback when they are being dragged. There are a couple scenarios to consider:

**Scale down the item while dragging a single element**

When dragging a single element, the element must be scaled down to 70% and accompany the cursor as shown in the image below:

**Multiple elements dragging**

When dragging multiple elements, you may need to indicate how many elements are being dragged. For that we offer a badge to reflect this amount. Please remember the following while dragging multiple elements:

* The badge must always be placed at the top-right from the cursor.
* Multiple selections are previewed together while grabbing the elements and moving them.

#### Drag Source

The drag source indicates the original position of the dragged element. It is only visible when the element is being dragged away from its original position (event: DragLeave).

There are two variants for showing feedback in the dragged element's source:

* Default: setting its opacity to 40%, as shown in the image below.
    
    ![the drag source gets an opacity of 40%](/images/lexicon/DnDDragSourceOpacity.jpg)

* Simplified placeholder: For cases that require a simpler approach, you can use a placeholder that is the same size as the element. Transform the element's background color to #272833 with a 4% opacity. This may require modification depending on the use case.

#### Valid Target

A valid target is the possible drop area of a dragged element. An element can have multiple valid targets on the same page. A valid target changes appearance, depending on the event:

**Default: No interaction**

A valid target is initially indicated with a grey background and a grey dashed border.

* This can be used in scenarios where files need to be dragged.
* Please use text inside to valid target to improve readability.

**DragEnter: Dragging Interaction**

Dragging an element into a valid target area activates the target area. When a target is activated, the border line style must remain the same and it must be turned blue, as shown in the image below:

![valid target active area ](/images/lexicon/DnDValidTargetActive.jpg)

**Drop and DropEnd: Dropping Result**

After dropping an element inside a valid target, the Drop and DropEnd event is triggered.

**Cards sorting example**

You can use the Drop/DragEnd event to magnetize the dragged element to the target. This improves the accuracy of the drag and drop action when the element changes position in the same page.

**Moving elements to a folder example**

Moving an element into another element to change its location (like a folder) will trigger an animation with a border that expands and hides. This indicates that the dropped element was moved. 
We also recommend that you show a success alert after the action is done. This will communicate that the elements were moved correctly and also give the user the possibility to undo the action, via a link.

**Sorting list items example**

Another way to define a valid target is to use a blue line of 4px between the elements.
We recommend that you use fluid animations to provide a more natural feedback of moving elements.
