### Can you share a fun fact about you?
​
Sometimes I pick my smartphone and my bluetooth speaker, I open some karaoke video on YouTube and I start to sing along, all by myself, just for fun. :D
​
​
### How did you get into design?
​
I wanted to work with something related to art and visual communication. I didn't know much about design, so that was my criteria to choose the course. During the first weeks, I started to discover how big it was. Understanding that design is about solution development for people's problems was a happy surprise.
​
​
### Favorite tool?
​
Trello (or anything that helps me to organize my kanban mural).
​
​
### Best lifehack?
​
Psychotherapy. Mental health is a blessing!
​
​
### Where do you find #inspiration?
​
I usually get inspired by things I consume. It can come from a video game menu, a movie art direction, a rock band album cover or some social media publication, for instance. Besides that, when I'm actively looking for specific references, I go to platforms like Pinterest, Behance, Designspiration and so on.
​
​
### One thing you are getting better at?
​
My English proficiency.
​
​
### One misconception about design you try to clear up?
​
Design isn't just graphic design. And graphic design isn't just beautiful screens.
​
​
### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?
​
I would be probably a musician.
​
​
### What does your desktop/home screen look like?
​
I try to keep it minimally organized, but you will always find some random files lying around.
​
​
### Favorite place to visit?
​
Toronto.
​
​
### Favorite hotkey?
​
Comnd-Z.
​
​
### Last book you read?
​
Blue Pills - a positive love story (A graphic novel by Frederik Peeters).
​
​
### Advice for ambitious designers?
​
Stay open for inspiration, stay open for feedbacks, ask for help and learn from your mistakes.
​
​
### Most effective productivity booster?
​
When I'm working, the pomodoro method. When doing things at home, keeping the smartphone away is a good choice.
​
​
### What keeps you up at night?
​
Video games (or my dog barking).
