## Vision

The goal of this guide is to give our content creators preferred writing style rules in order to create consistency in our marketing materials.

This is the official style guide for Liferay, developed by the team at the US headquarters, but we recognize that there may be regional differences for these guidelines. If something in this document conflicts with your content standards, please go with what is best for your region.

### General Guidelines

#### AP Style

Liferay uses the AP Style with some exceptions. There are [short guides available online](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/735/02/) that cover common mistakes.

#### Merriam-Webster

For questions of spelling, use the online [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/). For [commonly troublesome words](/blueprints/guidelines/writing/hard-words/), the style guide supersedes the dictionary.
