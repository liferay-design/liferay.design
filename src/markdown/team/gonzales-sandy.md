### Can you share a fun fact about you?

When I was a kid I used to draw on the walls of my house and my parents were upset because they had to paint them again. They used to say that in the future I would surely like art and that’s how it was.

### How did you get into design?

Ever since I can remember, I have been really passionate about art. I have always liked drawing and painting. 

When I was in high school my hobby was editing videos and photos, both things I learned by myself. Thanks to YouTube tutorials and Google it was easy to know how to use Sony Vegas, which was my favorite video editor back then and Photoshop too. When I finished high school, I knew which career to choose, I studied Graphic Design and after some years I made my transition to UX and UI design.

### Why are you at Liferay?

The main reason is teamwork. I saw a video on their website called “Life at Liferay” and I was interested in the comments from the employees, they mention that everyone is always available to help each other and the environment is really friendly. I was looking for a place where I can feel the support from my teammates and keep learning from experienced designers, I definitely found all that at Liferay.

### Favorite tool?

Adobe Audition, because I love to use it to record my singing covers and edit them to have studio results. 

I also love photography, so after taking some photos I like to use Photoshop to edit them with presets I created and then share on my socials.

### Best lifehack?

### Where do you find #inspiration?

I love everything related to art, so I am always inspired when I see art from the artists I follow on my social networks, also when I listen to music, when I watch animation series or movies or when I read books and comics.

### One thing you are getting better at?

To live a healthy life. I am learning how to eat healthy food and do exercises everyday.

### One misconception about design you try to clear up?

“Creativity cannot be taught.” That’s not true, we are all creative, but we need to learn how to use our creativity. We can learn by ourselves or with help from others.

### If you weren’t designing, what would you be doing?

I really like to edit videos even though I don’t do it anymore, but at some point of my career I wanted to work on post-production and the VFX industry.

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

My desktop only has a default macbook background, I like to have my desktop clean.

### Favorite place to visit?

1. Japan — especially Kyoto because I would love to visit lots of temples and shrines, they look magical.
2. United Kingdom — London to also visit the Warner Bros. Studio Tour: The Making of Harry Potter (Yeah, I’m a potterhead).
