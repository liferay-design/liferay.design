This message is meant to disappear after a short period of time, so it must be the case that the user doesn't have time to read it and there must not be a consequence for not reading it. This type of alerts have embedded links in case you need them.

#### Alert notification
Notifications display information about something that has happened or is happening in the system. These alerts are not related to actions that are being performed by the user at that moment. Unlike alerts, notifications are displayed on the top right corner of the screen. Both desktop and mobile notifications have similar dimensions.
