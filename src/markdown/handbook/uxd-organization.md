There is no better example of Liferay’s rapid growth than the 5 year period from 2012 to 2017, User Experience Team grew from 2 designers to over 30. It goes without saying that what works for 2 designers probably doesn’t easily scale well for 30 designers. Adding another designer is more complicated than adding another Design Tool.

We are going to face with several challenges. The first of which is how to best integrate the designers into their existing eco-system, this in isolation is a significant task. But adding to that is the logistical challenge of having teams dispersed over 4 locations – Budapest, Frankfurt, Los Angeles, Madrid and Recife – and three different times zones.

The question that we need to ask themselves is:

-   How do we ensure that knowledge and information are shared amongst teams in a smooth and natural way?.
-   How do we ensure that design, user research and information experience all work together cohesively and ensure the correct problems are being addressed for their users?.
-   How do we scale from 2 designers to 30 without breaking things?.

_**Unfortunately, there is no blueprint**_

Context defines how a design team forms and functions within a company. Every situation is unique. Therefore, a formula to build the perfect team does not exist.

## Fragmented experience

Creating an Inventory about Design and UXD, is not a great experience at all, is the perfect example of fragmented experience. Right now (November, 12, 2017), we have a level of inconsistency and fragmentation higher than when we were 6 designers.

In-depth analysis, Brand styles & official guidelines, naming, Market research, Platform & Brand Continuity, color, images, illustrations, design, AI, and interactions simply do not seem to be aligned anywhere. But it is not that all the products have to be aligned, and losing personality or differentiation, is that we look like 1001 different companies within Liferay.

And when I started talking about this, I realized that not just designers were trying to justify who or what vision was the right one. Let us be aware that if our teams are frustrated, surely our clients or potential customers will also feel the same.

Only with technology, we will not achieve any of our objectives.

So finally I concluded that the fragmentation is in our Design = Experience, is just the reflect of our fragmentation as Dpt/Team/Guild. Designers spread across so many different projects, different responsibilities, different libraries & tools, different Design Methods, different ways to title roles to design the same, different skill sets, just did not stand a chance to unify and go in the same direction.

Then, is not this common to all companies? Maybe, but what is not common is that when we are about to reach thirty designers, and with the certainty that Design is important, very important, we have not done anything to redirect it. Yes, our Design Experience is fragmented, our UX is fragmented.
