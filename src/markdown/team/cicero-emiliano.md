### How did you get into design? 🐸

I've always be surrounded by design, so I would say that design was into from day 0 of me in this Planet Earth. It is intrinsic to me, everything my eyes see is design, everything my hands create is design.

### Favorite tool? 🐚

Figma, I'm a Figma fan. I will never cheat Figma with any other tool that is not Framer, they seem to have a huge potential, early state though.

### Best lifehack? 🍕

Margarita pizza can tell you everything about an Italian restaurant.

### Where do you find #inspiration? 🍋

Limoncello always brings inspiration. Yes! I'm half Italian, the other half is Argentinian. Fernet works well those days I feel more Argentinian.

### One thing you are getting better at? 😏

Lately, I'm getting better at speaking in public and expressing my design knowledge. I feel in the correct path to talk as the design rock stars in the stage.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing? 📷

I guess I would be taking pictures and selling them for tons of money. This is something I haven't discard yet.

### Advice for ambitious designers? 😈

Do not look at [Ryan Connolly](../team/connolly-ryan), he is not a good influence.
