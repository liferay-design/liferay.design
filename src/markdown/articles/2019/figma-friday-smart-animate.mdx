Yesterday was an exciting day - Figma dropped their [Smart Animate](https://help.figma.com/article/365-smart-animate) feature out of nowhere.

Last week in our collaborative Figma Friday session, we explored what was possible with this new feature. The more we played around, the more we realized this could cover many of our prototyping needs without having to switch over to another tool like Principle. While Principle is still great for more complex interactions, having the ability to add more granular motion directly in our Figma prototypes allows us to better communicate animations and transitions in much less time. If you set up your layers well, it's literally one click to add some animation between two frames.

Here you can see a highly animated button that we made entirely in Figma. A button like this offers the user another level of feedback and engagement. This was accomplished by using Smart Animate paired with hover, click, and delay interactions.

This opens up many opportunities for prototyping, and the Liferay Design team is anticipating what future updates to this feature might bring. Based on our Figma Friday conversation, we thought of a few key features we would love to see in Smart Animate:

- Component transitions for consistency across prototypes.
- The ability to animate between scroll positions, like anchor links on the web
- Keyframes for individual layers. Right now we can achieve a similar effect through delays, but the ability to orchestrate staggered animations doesn't seem possible yet.

Smart Animate is launching not long after GIFs in prototypes were supported by Figma. Some of our designers were previously going into multiple other programs (Figma → After Effects →  Photoshop →  Figma) to create GIFs to illustrate motion within a prototype. This was a little cumbersome and caused load time issues, so Smart Animate is a very welcome addition to Figma's toolkit.

We're looking forward to sharing more we that create with Smart Animate!
