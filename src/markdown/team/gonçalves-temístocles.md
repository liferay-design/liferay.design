### How did you get into design?

I have enjoyed drawing since I was 8 years old. Over the years that skill always kept me close to an artistic/visual side, and that led me to apply for a bachelor's degree in design. It was a great fit, and now I fluctuate between multiple areas of design (graphic, motion, 3D‚Ä¶)

### Why are you at Liferay?

To develop my career as a designer, to challenge myself to work in a new environment, to meet new colleagues and expand my skills about working with a team, to train my english‚Ä¶ Many reasons!

### Favorite tool?

Cinema 4D for 3D in general, After Effects for motion design.

### Best lifehack?

Youtube is arguably the best source for learning the basics of most softwares and technical skills.

### Where do you find #inspiration?

Pinterest, Behance, Vimeo, Youtube, CGArchitect, Instagram‚Ä¶

### One thing you are getting better at?

My 3D skills (modeling and rendering specifically).

### One misconception about Design you try to clear up?

It‚Äôs not just about ‚Äúbeautiful things‚Äù, most design decisions (if not every single one) are there for a reason, either functional, symbolic, emotional...

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

Right now, probably trying my chances as a 3D Archviz artist.

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

Completely empty, not a single icon on my desktop. Everything is tucked and organized as much as I can in folders. My smartphone screen looks pretty neat as well.

### Favorite place to visit?

Anywhere my friends might be. :)

### Favorite superhero?

Monkey D. Luffy \o/

### Favorite hotkey?

Shift+c to bring up the search bar on Cinema 4D, and F9 to ease a keyframe on After Effects.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Do it with purpose. Any small or big decision in your design process benefits from having a solid reason why. Always avoid making decisions ‚Äújust because‚Äù (especially big ones).

### Last book you read?

The Lord of The Rings Series. I‚Äôve also tried reading ‚ÄúThe Capital‚Äù from Karl Marx, but the language was too dense for me, so I couldn't go much further.

### Most effective productivity booster?

If there‚Äôs a big project that feels overwhelming, separate it into small tasks.


### What keeps you up at night?

I might need extra therapy if I think too hard about that question! üòÖ
