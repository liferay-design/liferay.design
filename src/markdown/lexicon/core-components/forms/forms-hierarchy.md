<div class="page-description">The definition of the content hierarchy inside a form structure and the components used to identify the different content blocks.</div>

This page contemplates the visual definition of the hierarchy and the measurements and the definition of the components that establish that hierarchy.

### Layout

There are three main elements used to define the form hierarchy:
1. Form title
2. First level section header. This can be one of two options:
    1. The header of a fixed section
    2. The header of a collapsible section
3. Second level section header

The examples below demonstrate all these form elements working together within the same form structure:

Including explanatory text:

### Attributes

Metrics are key to understanding how our forms are built and how vertical spacing works in our forms.

#### Desktop

As mentioned in the [grid section](../../../designPrinciples/grid), the main vertical spacing reference is 24px.
