### Favorite tool?

Figma &mdash; and my 8' level.

### Best lifehack?

Go to bed before 11, wake up before 6.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

When I was younger, I wanted to be an architect &mdash; but now if I wasn't a designer, I'd probably want to build custom homes.

### Favorite place to visit?

Copenhagen, Denmark &mdash; it's such a happy, bikeable city. In the summer it's not too hot and there's tons of great coffee, food, and thrift stores.

### Favorite hotkey?

`⇧⌘L` &mdash; Select all occurrences of current selection

I'm pretty sloppy developer, I always need to go back and rename stuff or change lots of things, so this is super helpful.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Invest time in craft, [commit to doing things right](https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen/).

Don't say no to anything, take on challenges and things that will make you uncomfortable.

Don't make excuses &mdash; everybody is busy, people make time for what is important to them.

### Last book you read?

Taking Brand Initiative: How Companies Can Align Strategy, Culture, and Identity Through Corporate Branding by Majken Schultz and Mary Jo Hatch

### Most effective productivity booster?

Delete Facebook and Instagram from all your devices.

Highly recommend this &mdash; I did it a few years ago, and it's been great.

### What keeps you up at night?

The future.

JK &mdash; generally thinking about all the things I didn't accomplish during the day, week, month.

My 2-year old when he's sick.
