As part of the Modern Site Building project, the new editor represents an important shift in the way we create pages in Liferay. A completely new approach that has as main objective to empower business and non-technical users.

An intuitive and easy-to-use set of tools for building and managing content within pages that incorporates all the potential we already had, taking the flow of page creation to another level.
