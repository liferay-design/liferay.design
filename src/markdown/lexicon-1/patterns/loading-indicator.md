### Usage

This feedback mechanism is essential for the user to understand that something is happening. Please remember to include it when there is a connection to a server and at the same screen shows the answer to the user.

Please don’t use spinners inside buttons. In case you need a spinner for an action triggered by a button, place the spinner to one of the sides of the button.
