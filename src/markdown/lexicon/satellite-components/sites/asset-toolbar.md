The asset toolbar can contain tools, links, or informative elements. 

The toolbar is organized into two different groups of tools or informative elements. Most of the tools and content are grouped on the left, and the social tools are grouped on the right.

The “Share” button displays a dropdown menu containing a list of places/networks where the user can share. This list contains the social networks represented as icon buttons outside the list, as well as any additional social networks that are available.

### Examples of use

The same component in a 4-column container narrows to adapt to the available space:

On mobile displays, the component transforms its toolbar:
