### How did you get into design?

I used to draw the floor plan of every house I moved to when I was a kid and that turned into a desire to study architecture and urban planning when I was a teenager. Later on, the Internet came, so I started to decode websites' source codes, trying to figure out how things worked. A couple of years later I found out about a Graphic Design school (it was named "Industrial Drawing" at the time) and soon got my first web design internship.

### Best lifehack?
