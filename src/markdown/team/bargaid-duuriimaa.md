### How did you get into design?
I always found it very empowering to be able to bring an idea to life. I studied Fashion Design at the University of Arts London. It was my childhood dream to become a Fashion Designer so I loved working in it. But … I couldn't help notice, intrigued by how tech transforming societies in every possible way. The moment I realized how UX designers can design the human experience by using technology advancement I knew I wanted to be part of it,  So I left my career in fashion, started freelancing with the visual design, planning to eventually move to a product. Here I'm a product designer in Liferay I hope to do many exciting things in my professional adventure.
