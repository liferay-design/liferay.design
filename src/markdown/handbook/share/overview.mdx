## Creating, extending, and organizing content.


## Why

Sharing our work is important for increasing the influence of our department. Highlighting our work beyond finished products, to how and why we do things will help everyone. Sharing these things thoroughly and transparently has two primary benefits:

1. **Learning** — Our audience will gain a greater understanding of our perspective as designers, and we can learn from each other and our audience by creating an open environment for dialog.
2. **Confidence** — By articulating their reasoning, designers can better understand their work — and by having a deeper understanding of why we’re making decisions, the people we’re serving can feel that solutions are well-made. 


## How

As important as sharing our work is — it is secondary to actually doing the work. As a result, we need to be **strategic** and **well-organized** so that we don’t unnecessarily overburden individual contributors.

Managing all of this _could be_ someone’s full-time job. But our goal, by creating an open process that all can use and contribute to, is that between the whole department we can have an effective, cohesive, public-facing presence.

### Workplace

export const caption = <p>This is our Editorial Trello Board. It also has <a href='https://trello.com/b/CjHnF2Zs/editorial-calendar/calendar/2019/07'>a Calendar view</a>. If you aren’t in the Trello Team, <a href="https://trello.com/invite/liferaydesign/5094c905ce91e5adc6eeee02c513c70f">join today</a>!</p>

The reasons we’re using a Trello board to manage everything are threefold:



1. **Comprehensive View**
    Allows us to track the status of any post, ensuring that we’re posting **consistently** _(at regular intervals)_, **cohesively** _(posts are coordinated with each other)_, and **complementarily** _(posts drive traffic to multiple places)_.
2. **Centralized Tool**
    Allows everyone to have an **aggregate view** _(Board or Calendar)_ of what’s going on, empowering all to **contribute in their specialities** _(Lists or Cards)_. At any point during the process, you can add someone to a card and ask for their help or feedback.
3. Just kidding, there’s only two reasons.


## #TrustTheProcess

[The board](https://trello.com/b/CjHnF2Zs/editorial-calendar) is divided up into lists. While there is a linear flow to the lists, cards do not necessarily need to go through every single step, or always go in the same order.

_The following descriptions are listed in the ‘About’ card for each list._


### Ideas

_This is where anyone on our team is welcome to submit an idea for an article or post._

**All ideas are worth considering**, and all should brainstorm here **without fear of judgement**.

Each idea is its own card, and on the back is usually a description of the potential idea. This is also where one (or three) labels gets added, to further distinguish what type of content this article is categorized as.


### Research

_These ideas have now taken on new form: a contact to interview, an author eager to write on a certain subject, or just an outline that everyone agrees is worth exploring._

At this phase of a post's lifespan, the author adds themselves to the card. This way it is clear who has taken point on writing the piece, and everyone knows who to tag in the discussions.


### On Hold

_Sometimes ideas need time to cook — this list is where you can put a card until you can dedicate more time to it!_

**You can tag people and let them know the idea is up for grabs.**


### In Progress

_Usually these cards have a working draft attached, or at the very least a detailed outline._

They also most certainly **have a due date** by now, as we **schedule content in advance**.

When deciding on a due date, it’s easy to visualize the content landscape in calendar view. By pressing “Calendar” at the top right side of our board, we are able to see a breakdown of which cards are already scheduled and on which day. We typically aim to schedule 2-3 posts per week.


### Review

Cards go here when you'd like them to be reviewed. You should already have been reviewing your article or post with one or two other designers, this step is more of a "final" review.

**You can add people directly to the card, or share a link to the card in the [#des-feedback](https://liferay.slack.com/messages/CLARSSP9D) channel.**

For longer content, like articles or DBP posts, the review stage is also a great place to ask for graphics or illustrations from someone else!


### Scheduled

These posts are polished, having been reviewed by multiple people, and have a scheduled post date.


### Promotion

For content that can be cross-promoted on other platforms (e.g. if you've got a blog post and want Tweets or Dribbble shots generated from the content) this is the place to put that!

Create a checklist and start adding some Tweets, tag someone to review and then add them to Liferay's social media pipeline and the SM manager will schedule the posts.


### Ready to Publish

[different from ‘scheduled’ because we can’t always schedule posts — sometimes there is a manual process — need to better define]


### Published

Celebrate! We can use these cards to continue to promote articles and posts.

_Cards here will get periodically archived when the list gets full._
