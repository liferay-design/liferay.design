## Summary

**Wednesday 21st** 16:30-17:30 *- Solutions & Experts track*

In recent years we have been able to experience how a tool traditionally focused on developers is being increasingly accepted by less technical users. Marketers, designers and other business users can now have more autonomy to carry out their daily tasks in a more agile way, gaining an independence from the IT team that they would never have imagined a few years ago. In this space, several designers who have participated directly in the creation of these user experiences will talk about their experience throughout this evolution towards business user training models.
