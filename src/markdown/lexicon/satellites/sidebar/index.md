Sidebars can be used to almost any extent. Some of our use cases are:

* [Info panel](./infopanel): where we present dedicated information of an element such as a file
* [Product menu](./product-menu): that drives the main product navigation
* Toolbars: present in our builders, form builder, site builder, and segment builder
