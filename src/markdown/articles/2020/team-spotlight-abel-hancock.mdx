## What do you enjoy about your Product Designer role at Liferay?

I love getting to work with and learn from a team of talented designers while we solve problems for our customers and their customers. It inspires me how well we collaborate and are constantly seeking to improve the experience we provide for our end users. Liferay has seen a significant shift over the last three years in the focus we place on our users’ experience and it’s exciting to contribute to it.

## What made you decide to come to Liferay?

To be honest, I was looking for any work at the time. For me, a better question is probably why I have decided to (happily) stay for so long :) Liferay has a deep-rooted culture that truly values people, relationships, and the wellbeing of its employees. I have been able to create meaningful relationships with my team, grow as a designer and as a person, and contribute to both the companies success and the design community at large. For me, the intangible benefits of this job are as valuable as the more tangible ones.

## How are you challenged in your role?

Every day has its challenges when working to constantly improve your product and yourself. Working with and designing for people in different cultures, speaking different languages, and in different timezones has been eye-opening and creates unique collaboration challenges and design constraints.

## How have you seen yourself grow at Liferay?

At Liferay, I have had the opportunity to design our corporate website, contribute to our products, create solutions for clients, build out design infrastructure, and learn to code, among so many other things. I have grown in my design approach, how I interact professionally and interpersonally in a corporate environment, and in my understanding of the business and how design provides business value – all with the best support from a great team.

## When you tell people about Liferay what are some of the things you share?

Liferay is not a typical software company – the focus and value they place on their employees and customers is genuine and unrivaled. I’m lucky to get to work at this company, especially in these unique times.
