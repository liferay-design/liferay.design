We definitely appreciate contributions in any form &mdash; QA, [submitting issues](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/issues), providing feedback, code, design, etc.

If you're part of the Liferay team in Figma, there's a Liferay.Design project &mdash; you can see where we're at and contribute comments, designs, etc there.

If you'd like to help manage deployments, please [request to join our Netlify team](mailto:paul.hanaoka@liferay.com?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20join%20the%20Netlify%20team%20for%20Liferay.Design!&body=Pretty%20please!%20%0A%0A%5Badd%20some%20reasons%5D)!

## How To:

1.  Fork the repo.
1.  Clone your fork on your computer (local).
1.  Commit any changes to your local, then push to your origin.
1.  Create a pull request to upstream.

_(If "local", "origin", and "upstream" are greek to you, [see this top answer on Stack Overflow.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9257533/what-is-the-difference-between-origin-and-upstream-on-github))_

**Important Notes**

1. All work should be done on the `master` branch (or you can create your own branch and request to merge it with the `master` branch.

1. We always `Rebase & Merge` pull requests so that the commit history is kept as clean as possible â€” to that end, be sure to follow the best practices outlined below to avoid merge conflicts in your PRs.
