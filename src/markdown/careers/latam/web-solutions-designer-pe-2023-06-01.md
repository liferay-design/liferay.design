## Who Are We Looking For?

We’re looking for an experienced, collaborative, and proactive Web Designer who will create a consistent brand and user experience across our digital touchpoints.

As Web Designer you will work with the Staff Designer to care for the user experience and visual identity of our primary site – liferay.com – in close partnership with our Web Marketing and Solutions team. In addition, you will design landing pages for diverse campaigns and engaging websites for Liferay events. All this will create compelling and engaging digital experiences that leverage and contribute to our brand. You will develop and maintain web brand guidelines to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience across all of Liferay’s web properties.

In addition to your web responsibilities, you will be supporting the Solutions Team in designing attractive, organized, modern interfaces while delivering amazing, smooth web experiences for users. You will create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to effectively communicate user experience requirements and solutions capabilities to stakeholders and team members.

### Key Objectives:

- Advocate for user experience and ensure alignment between marketing, sales, and design to create a cohesive marketing site [(liferay.com)](liferay.com)
- Execute the redesign of liferay.com to express and evolve our brand through web design.
- Create polished landing pages and microsites to support global and local digital marketing campaigns.
- Maintain and expand a Figma component library used across multiple web properties
- Evolve our brand guidelines for web and documentation to better serve our growing company

### Required Qualifications

In addition to a **solid foundation in UX/UI** here is what you’ll need to succeed here:

- **Communication skills:** Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. We work closely with multiple teams (marketers, developers, designers) in different locations around the world.
- **Eagerness to work with others:** You’re going to work with a lot of different business units — marketing, sales, support, human resources, customer success, and probably more. The ability to empathize, connect, and succeed with people who are different from you is critical.
- **Lead by serving:** This job will require working with multiple teams, competency in our products, and empowering others to create effective web experiences. While we don’t expect all of this on day one, we’d like to see that you’ve done something similar!

### Preferred Qualifications

- Advanced or fluent in English to communicate with our global team
- Strategic and analytical thinking
- Deep understanding of best practices in modern web design
- Experience writing and maintaining brand guidelines for web
- A strong portfolio that demonstrates brand cohesively tied across pages & sites

- Front end Development skills (a bonus)
