## Creating Pages

There are two options for making a page:

1. **filename.md** — this is [a markdown file](https://github.github.com/gfm/), the filename will be the url.
1. **filename.mdx** — this is [an MDX file](https://mdxjs.com/) — very similar to markdown, but lets you use data and components for more dynamic and interactive content.

_Note that in these two options, any images you reference will need to be stored in the `static` folder and referenced accordingly._

There are two ways to organize pages:

1. **Files** — If you want to quickly create a page, and don't need many images this is an easy way to go.
1. **Folders** — If you have a lot of images, create a folder (folder name will be the url, index.md/x file will be the content), images inside the folder will be transformed by Gatsby and you can reference inside of markdown (e.g. `![Alt text](./image-name.jpg)`).

## Images

### Inline Markdown Images

Use the conventional markdown syntax — `![Alt text](/relative-path-to-image/file-name.jpg)`. The image will render at the file dimensions, with a max-width of the container that its in. So if a file's dimensions are 1200x800 pixels, then it will fill the width of the markdown container.

### <Image> Component

Note that you need to import the image at the top of the file: 

`import { Image } from 'components/atoms'`

The Image component is very powerful and has potential for almost endless extensibility.
