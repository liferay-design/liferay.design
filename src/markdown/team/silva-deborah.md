### How did you get into design?  

When I got my first computer, there were those two software programs that I liked to play around. The first one was Front Page and it allowed you to create and publish HTML websites, and the other one was Paint that let you create drawings/illustrations. Both of them got me interested in creating things digitally, so later on when I discovered a Design course at my local university and that I could do things like that as a profession I just had to apply.
