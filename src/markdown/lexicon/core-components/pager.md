### Usage

Pagers are commonly used in forms that are chucked because of their length.

### Variations

#### Default pager

Use the default pager when you need a simple pagination pattern that does not require the page size to be changed.

#### Aligned pager

The aligned pager aligns the links to the left and right.

### States

States inform the user where the process has its limits and where it can go. Make sure you disable and enable them properly according to the sequence.

### Sizes

When deciding a size to use, consider the available space and the hierarchical importance:

| Size    | Description                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Small   | The font-size is 12px and the proportions are smaller. |
| Default | The font-size is 16px and the proportions are smaller. |
| Large   | The font-size is 18px and the proportions are bigger.  |
