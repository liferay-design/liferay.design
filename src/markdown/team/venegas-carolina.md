### Best lifehack?

Learning another language. Google the pronouns, most common words, expressions, prepositions, connectors and the present-past-future tenses — it’s simple! These words are about 20% of the language, but they are used 80% of the time. Translate it into your native language and once you have that, start with music, TV shows, Disney, and more… Voilá!

### [What keeps you up at night?](http://whatkeepsyouupatnight.io)

Will our year of 2020 be called “the 20’s” in the future? Will people think about the technology we use in these days and say things like “back then when the internet was created”. I keep just thinking about how we can imagine that future today. So thinking a little bit about designing the future and creating this utopic world.
