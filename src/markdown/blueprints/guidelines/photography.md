## Why Use Photography?

Images quickly convey complex information, feelings, and emotions. When used correctly, they increase the memorability of the other content they're supporting.

## Guidelines

1. **Reinforce the Content**

    - There should be some intentionality behind your choices, however there is power in suggestion and subtlety &mdash; you don't need to have a 1:1 correlation between the title and the photo.

1. **Be Human** (reflect reality)
    - Be authentic and genuine &mdash; don't look staged
    - Put a face to technology
        - People behind it
        - People benefiting from it
        - Intentional, relatable use of emotion
    - There is inherent value in diversity
        - Try to avoid excessively styled photos or stereotypical personas
1. **Be Clear and Harmonious**
    1. The [composition](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/11-thoughts-introduction-photographic-composition) should be [aesthetically pleasing](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-tips/composition-tips-simply-beautiful-photos/)
    1. The photograph should not have to rely on obvious edits or stock filters to be compelling
    1. The best editing goes unnoticed
1. **Be Legal** &mdash; don't use copyrighted images without the appropriate permissions or licenses in place.

## Technical Requirements

_Always Be Optimizing._ See the [Photography Resources](/blueprints/resources/photography) page for more on image optimization.

### What format should I use?

#### JPEG/JPG

Generally anything photographic — i.e. that has a wide variety of colors and shades

_Generally, most photos are best left as jpegs, or in this case, not taken at all._

_Initially, you'd think this would be better as a PNG or GIF since it's mostly graphical, however there is quite a range of colors, and a gradient so even though it won't render as nicely as a PNG, JPEG is the better choice because it will be significantly smaller._

#### GIF/PNG
