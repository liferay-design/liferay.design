A high priority for our business is establishing a design practice in the APAC region.

1. **Communication skills**

    Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!

1. **Proficiency with modern design tools and systems**

    Our design system is in Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly, so a track record of tool and system competency is required.

### Language Requirement:

- English: Business Level
- Japanese: Business Level

## What does the application process look like?

1. You send a great portfolio and note, along with your application.
1. Our recruiting manager reviews it, and passes it along to our design hiring managers.
1. The hiring managers will review your portfolio and application and our recruiter will schedule a short phone call with you to confirm details about your application.
1. The recruiting manager will then schedule an interview with your future manager.
1. Congratulations! You’ve made it to the final round — you’ll have a group call with some of the other designers.
