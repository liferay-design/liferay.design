A strong feedback culture is a differentiator — among other things it:

-   Improves individuals and the team as a whole
-   Reduces blind spots
-   Builds trust
-   Demonstrates mutual respect
-   Helps to build a strong team

## Receiving Feedback

Before we talk about giving feedback, we should practice receiving feedback. This fosters a culture of feedback and mutuality.

This aligns with our values of **Lead by Serving** and **Value People**. Giving feedback starts with receiving feedback, and doing so in a solicited way is
less stressful.

### Appreciate the effort of giving feedback to you

1. Say "thank you"
1. Be gracious - it’s hard to deliver feedback well
1. Set the tone

### Understand first

1. Acknowledge the received feedback
1. Clarifying, open questions to understand deeper
1. Closed questions to confirm your understanding

### Stay Open

1. Don’t make excuses
1. Don’t go on the offensive
1. Don’t downplay the feedback

### Act on Feedback

1. Make agreements on possible solutions
1. Follow-up on unresolved feedback

## Solicited feedback

1. How would you like to receive feedback?
1. Do you know your people well enough?
    1. What is a threat and what is a reward?
    1. What is an emotional deposit or withdrawal?
