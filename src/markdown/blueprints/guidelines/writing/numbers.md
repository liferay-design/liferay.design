## Cardinal and Ordinal Numbers

Spell out cardinal numbers (one, two and so on) and ordinal numbers (first, second and so on) below 10, but use numerals for numbers 10 and above.

_Examples:_

-   Aunt Bea’s pickles won first place at the fair.
-   Does your building have a 13th floor?
-   With a premium license, install the software on three computers.

## Numbers in Titles

Use numerals for cardinal and ordinal numbers in headlines, email subject lines and HTML page titles.

_Examples:_

-   In Pamplona, 8 Injured in “Running of the Bulls” (Headline)
-   Subject: Presentation file 1 of 2 attached (Email subject line)
-   5th Grader Wins 1st Place in Spelling Bee (Headline)

## Percentages

When expressing percentages, always use numerals and the percentage sign. Don’t spell out percentages.

_Examples:_

-   The study revealed that 8% of respondents were ambivalent.
-   Spell out percentages 100% of the time if you have any respect for written language.

## Date and Time

Always use AM and PM for indicating time. Dates should be written without superscript (10th, 11th and so on) because the formatting doesn’t always work in emails or on social media.

_Examples:_

-   The webinar will be held on Friday, August 27 at 4 PM EST.
-   Trainings will be offered on Thursday, February 1 at 10:30 AM and 2 PM EST.

## Numerals in Categories

If a passage contains two or more numbers that refer to the same category of information and only one is 10 or higher, use numerals for all numbers referring to that category. When numbers are treated consistently, readers can recognize the relationship between them more easily.

_Examples:_

-   The delegation included 3 women and 11 men.
-   He was the 9th person chosen for the 10-person team.

## Large Numbers

Express very large numbers in numerals followed by million, billion and so on. If expressing a number greater than 999 in numerals, use a comma.

_Examples:_

-   5 billion people
-   1,200 years ago

## Millions and Billions

When stating million or billion with a numeral, don’t hyphenate, even before a noun. But do use a hyphen between the numeral and million or billion if the expression is part of a compound adjective that takes a hyphen elsewhere.

_Examples:_

-   A $6 million lawsuit
-   The 400-million-served mark

If space is tight (e.g., in headlines, tables, diagrams or social media posts), some abbreviations are acceptable.

_Examples:_

-   M (million)
-   B (billion)
-   K (thousand) - Among other things, K can stand for thousand, kilobytes, kilobits and kilograms. Use K only if its meaning is clear from the context.
