# src

The src folder is where all the code is that gets compiled into a `public` folder which gets rendered onto the interwebs at [our domain](https://liferay.design). We roughly follow [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) principles.

## components

Where all of our react components live &mdash; atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and theme.

## images

TODO: resolve duplicate `images` folders (static/images)

## markdown

This is where 98.3% of the site content lives &mdash; [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a lot easier to write than html ðŸ¤“.

## pages

Surprise surprise, this is where the code for the main pages of [liferay.design](https://liferay.design) lives.

## theme

Stylesheets and other theme-related files.

## utils

[Auth](https://wedeploy.com/docs/auth/getting-started/) is our only utility &mdash; but it's so great it gets its own folder.
