Meetings can be a very costly investment — we would think very carefully about spending \$500, so we should think even more carefully about scheduling an hour-long meeting with 8 people.

The following guidelines are designed for minimal, yet effective meetings:

1. **Goal oriented** — Meeting invites should include a clear agenda, otherwise how will people know that the meeting will be worth their time?
1. **As brief as possible** — Start on time and stick to the agenda — don’t wait for people, if they’re late its for a good reason, your accurate notes should be enough for them to catch up on anything they’ve missed.
1. **Open meeting notes** — Keep open meeting notes with clearly documented outcomes and action items so that anyone who wasn’t in the meeting can quickly understand the value and to-dos.
1. **Open door policy** — When the meeting is no longer relevant to you, leave — don't sit in 2-hour long groomings if you're only contributing or getting value from 10 minutes of it.
