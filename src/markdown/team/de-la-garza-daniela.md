### Can you share a fun fact about you?

Whenever I like a song I obsess over it and play it nonstop, so maybe for a road trip it‚Äôs better if someone else picks the music.

### How did you get into design?

I‚Äôve always liked ‚Äúmaking‚Äù things (from clay figures, to jewelry, baking, postcards‚Ä¶), so it felt natural for me to take on a creative career. I studied Industrial Design but discovered that I still liked doing other kinds of projects, so I got into Graphic and right now I feel that Web Design might be something I‚Äôd like to explore.

### Why are you at Liferay?

Because aside from having the opportunity to work with really talented designers, I think it‚Äôs a company with a unique people-centered culture, and I like that it promotes giving back and helping our communities.

### Favorite tool?

Grids, even when you might want a messy look, a bit of structure evens your composition out and makes it easier for people to read.

### Best lifehack?

Get a dog ü§ó

### Where do you find #inspiration?

Coffee table books, architecture and artisans across Mexico.

### One thing you are getting better at?

Preparing my own mocktails.

### One misconception about design you try to clear up?

That anyone can do it.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

I see myself with my very own ceramics shop, I just find it so relaxing and beautiful.

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

A cool background, sometimes really tidy and organized and others full of screenshots and stacks.

### Favorite place to visit?

Any cool beach or interesting town. I like many destinations here in Mexico, but Vietnam, Brazil and Australia have been in my bucket list for a while.

### Favorite superhero?

I think I usually prefer antagonistic characters, I find them very interesting, so maybe Deadpool or Poison Ivy.

### Favorite hotkey?

‚åòZ  and  ‚åò‚áßZ  (on repeat and/or looping)

### Last book you read?

I re-read Homo Sapiens of Yuval Noah Harari.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

There‚Äôs no need to invent the wheel for every project, some times best ideas are the simplest.

### Most effective productivity booster?

Doing something else for a little while, like taking a 10 min walk, sometimes you have to disconnect to see your project with fresh eyes.

### Best interview question?

What‚Äôs the last thing outside your comfort zone you did?

### What keeps you up at night?

That extra cup of coffee I had because I got cold.

### Favorite quote?

There is light
Around every shadow
Train your eyes
To see them both."
