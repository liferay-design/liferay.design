## What is a Task?

Tasks are single to-dos, assigned to one employee, and planned in a specific sprint. Tasks are oftentimes part of a story and cross-linked.

### Understanding Tasks

- Tasks are being used to plan specific tasks which should not take more than 1 working day.
- They could be part of a bigger project or planned by themselves.
- Tasks can be separated into subtasks.
- Tasks can be assigned to a responsible employee (aka assignee).
- Tasks are part of a sprint or scrum.
- They are being worked on actively, can be forwarded to someone else for feedback, and can be marked as done when finished.
- Tasks can be cross-linked and can block each other.


### Creating a Task

Keep track of the things that need to get done with tasks. With the ability to give each task an assignee and due date, and plenty of ways to see your tasks, you can make sure nothing slips through the cracks.
