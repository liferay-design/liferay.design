Easil has two main sections: **Templates** and **Workspace**.

## Templates

This is your starting point for each project. Here you will find a library of all current Liferay-branded templates. You can also search by tag or image size.

You can filter your view by selecting a size from the dropdown on the right. Available sizes:

-   **Facebook, LinkedIn** - 1200 x 627
-   **Twitter** - 1024 x 512
-   **Email** (displayed as “**Custom**”) - 568 x 300

Each Liferay-branded template has several variations, known as Pages. They include things like: co-branded logos, CTA buttons, speaker headshot circles, etc.

## Workspace

This is your own personal space to work on specific designs and store previous ones. **Any templates that you click on in the Templates section will automatically open as copies in your Workspace.**
