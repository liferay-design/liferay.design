## Why Principles?

The answer is simple — they provide a shared framework so we can make better decisions together, faster.

Our principles are the [result of an exercise](/articles/2018/liferay-design-week-2018#design-principles) with all of the designers at Liferay during Design Week in January 2018.

Each principle includes additional key-words, a brief summary, as well as a series of questions that are designed to help designers apply these principles in their day-to-day work.

_See our [Principles page](/principles) for an interactive version._

### Intentional

**Simple** • **Intuitive** • **Effective**

_Eliminate unnecessary complexity. Be easy to understand, regardless of the person's knowledge or concentration level._

-   Are my designs passing [heuristics tests](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics)?
-   Are my designs reducing problem complexity by addressing simple and focused tasks?

    />

-   Are my designs achieving the business goal?
-   Are my designs adding value to the system?
-   Can I articulate the value my design is adding to the user?

### Inclusive

**Universal** • **Open** • **Consistent**

_Design for real people, not stereotyped personas. Reflect reality; use expected, contextual patterns and natural metaphors._

-   Are my designs passing [accessibility tests](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/)?
-   Am I designing in a non-discriminative way?
-   Am I empowering my users to do their tasks?
-   Are we contributing to the design community?
-   Do I know the groups and the people that my designs are for?

### Honest

**Affordant** • **Transparent** • **Human**

_Be clear, transparent, and straightforward. Respect people’s needs and resources, like attention and time._

-   Am I using the correct [affordances](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/affordances) to solve the problem?
-   Are you testing and validating your designs with people?
-   Am I using dark patterns?
-   Are my designs ethical?
-   Am I working to continuously reduce the cognitive load for users?

### Pleasurable

**Emotions** • **Genuine** • **Reliable**

_Design products that all people enjoy using. Intentionally produce your best, down to the minutiae._

-   Am I spending time with users to understand their emotions?
-   Are people better for experiencing the work we do?
-   Do people find delight and joy when experiencing our designs?
-   Are my designs performant, functional, and usable?
-   Is my design authentic and based in timeless principles?
