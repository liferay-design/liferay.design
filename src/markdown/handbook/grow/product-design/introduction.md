The Product Design team works with product management and engineering, and is concerned with the optimization of business value and user experience.

<!-- For a complete overview of how we constructed the Product Design verticals, see [our article in Smashing Magazine](#TODO-add-link-to-article). -->

## Verticals

### Strategy

Business in the context of design is the ability to understand the market, contribute to business goals to solve problems and create tools to improve the design lifecycle.

[Read all Strategy milestones](.././strategy)

### Research

User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies.

[Read all Research milestones](.././research)

### Interaction

Interaction Design combines Usability, Information Architecture, and other disciplines to deliver easy to use products.

[Read all Interaction milestones](.././interaction)

### Visual

Visual design shapes the product experience through artifacts like illustrations, photography, typography, color and more to improve the usability of products.

[Read all Visual milestones](.././visual)

### Engineering

Engineering in the context of design is the ability to understand and contribute to the various technologies and frameworks that are used in the designerâ€™s context.
