_A vital part of making a design request is providing all the pertinent information and parameters, so the team can efficiently and effectively meet the business goals of your project._ 

_Our request forms in Jira have been designed to make it clear to the reporter (that’s you) what details are needed for us to start and identifies some commonly-requested assets in an effort to reduce the back-and-forth._

## Choosing the right Issue Type

99.9% of the time, Design Request will be what you're looking for — the other .1% of the time is if you've got a webinar that you want created.
