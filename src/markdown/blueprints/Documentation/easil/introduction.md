To meet the growing demand for social media and email banner assets across our global offices, we’ve undertaken to streamline the design process by empowering marketers to create their own assets from Liferay-branded templates.

Enter [Easil](http://app.easil.com 'Easil'): it’s a powerful web-browser that app allows you to create social media and email graphics from Liferay-branded templates in a variety of export sizes.

## Set Up

Before you begin:

1. To be added to the Liferay Easil Team, post your request in **[#com-des-easil](slack://channel?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CM1HX3E95)** with the hashtag **#easilAccess**. An Easil invite will be sent to your Liferay account, and the link in the email will take you to the login page.
2. Create an account by filling in the right-side blanks and creating a password. **Do NOT use the “Register Using Google Account” button on the left.**
3. Once logged in, confirm that you can access the Liferay Team templates.
