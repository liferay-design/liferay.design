### Style

The overall style of the Liferay brand illustrations is a mix of simplified organic shapes with a technology-centric feel. The style is meant to be more playful and approachable. The lack of defined facial features is to create a purposefully relatable experience for the viewer.

### Characteristics

Common characteristics and motifs throughout the illustrations are the junction of human forms with technology and also simplified metaphors related to the content.

### Uses

These illustrations have three uses: they provide a more approachable and engaging experience for the user, they provide contextual navigation clues to where the user is on the site, and they supplement and bolster the section copy.

### What to Avoid

It’s important to avoid using an illustration INSTEAD of text content. The illustrations are meant to support textual messaging on the page, not the other way around. Avoid having copy interfere or obstruct the illustration in any way. Avoid altering the colors of the illustrations or converting them to grayscale. Do not cut off parts of the illustration -- they must be viewed as they were originally intended.

### Colors & Color Schemes

(in Figma)

### Textures

A grain texture is to be applied to shadows where seen fit. The grain can be applied to both mid and dark shadow shapes. It is up to the designer to make sure whatever choice they make creates a harmonious experience within the illustration.

### Figures

Figures Rules: Figures are to be presented as fairly flat with some depth. The depth is created by adding darker tones to the legs or arms that are further away from our user. Depth is also created with organic shadow shapes on our figures. Although the figure shapes should be fairly flat with some curves, the shadows should be created to reflect true body curvature. Shadows should be simplified to create larger shape mass.

### Materials

Any and all materials can be used in these illustrations. It is up to the designer to use the style rules to create those materials.

### Composition (bg, mid-ground, foreground)

Where possible, the designer should create three layers to each illustration. In each illustration there should be a background, a mid-ground, and a foreground. The background is typically the atmosphere -- in most cases this can be created with an organic shape and clouds to illustrate a sky backdrop. The mid-ground will be our environment. This is where most of the illustration should live. It should answer 1) where are we? 2) why are we here? 3) what is happening? The foreground should ideally support our illustration’s main character and action. The main focus and attention should be on the foreground element(s).
Rule of Thirds
It is up to the designer to respect the rule of thirds when planning an illustration. The main

### Ratios & Proportions

Ideal illustrations should be close to square in ratio. Unless a specific spot illustrations calls for full-width sizing then the designer should aim for a square ratio.

### Focal Points

The foreground, with primary action, should be the focal point of the illustration.

### Metaphors & Message

It’s important to keep the illustration’s metaphor fairly simple. It should reflect the core essence of the messaging but should not attempt to incorporate every sub-concept of the page copy. The illustration is meant to offer an idea, not replace copy and messaging.

### Lighting

The global lighting angle is somewhat flexible. The ideal lighting is either a direct 90 degree angle or any angle between 90 and 135.
