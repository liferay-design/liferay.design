    content: |
        While we recognize that there are differences in each team‚Äôs skills, there are also similarities in what makes a ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù of any profession, a designer. As a department, we want to steward and attract designers that add to Liferay‚Äôs culture.

        The Design Department is comprised of three teams; Communication, Product, and Research. Each of those teams determines the skills required to be a designer on that team. These skills should be relevant to the market and also reflect the ways in which we‚Äôre adding value to the company.

        This year Design for Life(ray) served Underground Writing, an organization that runs creative workshops that empowers personal transformation in migrant, incarcerated, recovery, and other at-risk communities through literacy.

        Liferay designers spent some time at the end of the year to give Underground Writing a top to down make-over. This included a brand new website, completely revamped tech stack, and service design optimizations.
