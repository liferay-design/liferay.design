Liferay DXP introduced in 7.3 version the possibility of switching to a slightily different menu approach. This new experience leaves only the site administration in the Product Menu. Therefore, we differ between 2 variants:

* Product Menu with Global Menu active
* Product Menu without Global Menu active

### Product Menu with Global Menu active

### Product Menu without Global Menu active

This option is more conservative and offers the same experience we use to have in all 7.x Liferay DXP versions.
