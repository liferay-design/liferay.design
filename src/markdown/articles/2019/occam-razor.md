## Summary
Occam’s Razor is a problem-solving principle that states that simplicity is better than complexity. We can adopt Occam’s Razor as a guiding principle that informs our decisions and keeps us from reaching for a complex solution when a simpler one is sufficient.  
It’s easy for us to get carried away and make designs that may have a lot of functionality, We assume it enhances the user’s experience but when in reality it's confusing difficult to use. thats, partly because low-complexity websites don’t require our eyes and brain to work as hard to decode, store, and process information.

## Takeaway
To apply Occam’s Razor

1.  We must evaluate every design element based on it’s a necessity. We must constantly ask ourselves when designing: “What is the minimum amount of UI that will allow the content to be found and effectively communicate to the user?”.
2.  Edit Ruthlessly  
    Remove as many as possible, without compromising the overall function ""A design isn’t finished when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away""
