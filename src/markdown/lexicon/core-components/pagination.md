### Variations

#### Pagination

Use the default pagination when you need a simple pagination pattern for a page that will not change size.

Pagination includes several mechanisms to move between pages:
* Left arrow:
    * Navigates backward one page
    * Disabled when the first page is selected
* Numbers: redirects directly to a certain dataset chunk (page) calculated with the page size
* Ellipsis:
    * Appears when the number of pages exceeds six
    * Displays a dropdown menu with the rest of the pages
    * It is always shown in a middle position
 * Right arrow:
    * Navigates forward one page
    * Disabled when the last page is selected

### Pagination bar

![pagination bar with a dropdown for page size and the simple pagination component](/images/lexicon/PaginationBar.jpg)

A pagination bar is pagination with the following features: 
* A page size selector placed on the left side of the bar
* A label on the right side of the page size selector that displays the exact chunk of information displayed from the dataset
* Classic pagination on the right side of the bar that adapts to the number of pages

Use the pagination bar when you need a complex pagination pattern that requires changing the page size and re-calculating the number of pages. 

Description:

![pagination bar with parts descriptive with numbers for the description](/images/lexicon/PaginationBarParts.jpg)

2. Descriptive text to clarify the dataset segment shown.
3. Back arrow
4. Selected page
5. Non-selected page
6. Ellipsis to select intermediate pages through a dropdown menu. Since there are so many pages, it's impossible to view all the pages at once.
