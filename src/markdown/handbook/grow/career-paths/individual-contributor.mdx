Each skill is split into 5 levels in an approximately exponential scale. This is designed to accomodate early-career designers leveling up at an appropriate rate, and prevent the inflation or creation of essentially meaningless job titles that serve to confuse rather than reflect the true value a mid and senior level designer brings.
