### How did you get into design?

It wasn't a love-at-first-sight story. I worked as an architect and realized that it no longer made sense to my life, even though I loved to create new things and see the impact they could make on people's lives. So I sought another profession in which I could use some skills that I already had. That's when I found Design.


### Why are you at Liferay?

I'm at Liferay because it's a fertile ground for growth and because I have the opportunity to work with amazing people.


### Favorite tool?

Paper and pen, in the beginning, to organize ideas. After that, Figma.


### Best lifehack?

Do some kind of social media fasting from time to time and watch the hours of your day multiply.


### Where do you find #inspiration?

Being aware and present, watching the world. It is possible to get inspired by the most unexpected things.


### One thing you are getting better at?

My visual skills, speaking English and being present. 


### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

Probably would still be working with Interior Design or something related to heritage preservation.


### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

It's a set of photos of the places I've traveled and the ones I still want to know.


### Favorite place to visit?

* Olinda during Carnival, Brazil.
* Seville, Spain.
* San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. 


### Advice for ambitious designers?

I'm not yet in a position to give advice to designers, for now, I'm trying to follow the advice they gave me. But I think it's very important to look for mentorship, and learn from more experienced designers.


### Last book you read?

The Story of a New Name, by Elena Ferrante


### Most effective productivity booster?

An organized place, coffee and good music.


### What keeps you up at night?

To be honest, I like to sleep a lot and I intend to keep that habit. What can keep me awake sometimes is a good conversation with good friends.
