### How did you get into design?

I guess it was after having my first contact with a personal computer and the flourishing digital scene back in the late 90s - I was really impressed with the endless possibilities regarding design, communication and technology. During highschool I was the one who did the cool drawings, illustrations and graphic stuff look good.

### Why are you at Liferay?

The company culture and values have inspired me.

### Favorite tool?

Pencil and paper (or a good tablet and digital pen where I can scketch, draw and take notes).

### Best lifehack?

Waking up to watch the sunrise with a cup of hot chocolate.

### One thing you are getting better at?

Paddling (Hawaiian Outrigger Canoeing).

### Where do you find #inspiration?

Art in general... specially in music and books - of course I couldn't live without Mr. Google.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

At some point of my life I thought about studying Medicine to be a Plastic Surgeon. I always wanted to make a better world somehow - so problably I'd be helping people and protecting 'Mother Nature' around the world along with a nonprofit organization.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Be curious. Be humble. Do your best and always "walk the talk".

### Last book you read?

"Liftoff!: Practical Design Leadership to Elevate Your Team, Your Organization and You" by Chris Avore and Russ Unger.
Currently reading "Thinking in Systems" by Donella H. Meadows

I usually keep a neverending reading list (and yes - I still prefer books over e-books).

### Favorite place to visit?

Santorini, Greece - it's an amazing island with impressive scenery and beautiful landscape. The country has great food, white wine and unique olive oil (with the blessings from Zeus, Dionysus, Hestia and other greek gods). 

Fernando de Noronha, Brazil - a piece of Paradise located only 45 min flight from Recife.

### Favorite superhero

Cyclops

### Most effective productivity booster?

Listening to Bon Jovi, any AOR or melodic rock playlist.

### What keeps you up at night?

My two daughters.  ;)
