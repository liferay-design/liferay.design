## What will my first year look like?

The Marketing team has plans to do an overhaul of liferay.com this year — you’ll make a serious impact at the company right off the bat! 

You’ll also be supporting all of our regional marketers as we continue to increase the level of self-service using the site-building features in our core product — Liferay DXP. This includes helping us take style.liferay.design to the next level!

Those things should keep you pretty busy — but you don’t have to worry about getting bored, there’s always something to design for the web. 
the type of work you’ll be doing.

## Role & Requirements

In addition to a solid foundation in design (typography, color, layout, etc) here is what you’ll need to succeed here:

1. **Communication skills**: Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. We work closely with multiple teams (marketers, developers, designers) in different locations around the world.
2. **Eagerness to work with others**: You’re going to work with a lot of different business units — marketing, sales, support, human resources, customer success, and probably more. The ability to empathize, connect, and succeed with people who are different than you is critical.
3. **Lead by serving**: This job will require working with multiple teams, competency in our products, and empowering others to create effective web experiences. While we don’t expect all of this on day one, we’d like to see that you’ve done something similar!


## What will set you apart:
* **Experience writing and maintaining brand guidelines for web**
* **A strong portfolio that demonstrates brand cohesively tied across pages & sites**
* **Yes, designers should code — if they want to**
* **Experience working with Marketing teams in large organizations**


### Location Note
_We are currently fully remote, but are planning to return to the office when it’s safe per local guidelines. There is currently no timetable for this._ 


## What do you need to apply?

1. Link to your website that includes recent, relevant case studies
2. Cover letter (nothing formal!) with 3-5 sentences about your experience working in low-code environments.


## Cover letter? Do you really read them?

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
