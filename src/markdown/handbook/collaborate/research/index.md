### How do we work?

Research Design team works as a service. In our daily bases, we receive requests from different product teams. These request are prioritized depending on the product needs and roadmap. Therefore, although all resquests are covered, some of them can take longer than others to start.

### What we do?

Right now our department is focused on qualitative testing, as it is the highest demand. But we expect to be working shortly in quantitative tests as well.

On top of that, we constantly feed our research repository with all information extrated from tests. This repository allows us to extract reports and idenitify commonalities as to improve the way Product Design makes its job.

Moreover, as a way to give back to the community, we write articles. They are small pieces of information for other designers to learn more about research.
