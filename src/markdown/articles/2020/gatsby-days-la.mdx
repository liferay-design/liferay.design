# Gatsby Days LA

If you’ve followed me for any length of time [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/plhnk), you’ve probably seen [multiple](https://twitter.com/plhnk/status/1105699555994042369?s=20) [professions](https://twitter.com/plhnk/status/1123007662403100673?s=20) [of](https://twitter.com/plhnk/status/1177429306894512128?s=20) [love](https://twitter.com/plhnk/status/1220226057648762880?s=20) for [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org). When I saw they were hosting a one-day, single-track conference less than 20 miles (less than 2 hours in LA traffic) from my house, I couldn’t _not_ attend.

Liferay.design has been running on Gatsby [since early 2018](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/search?o=asc&q=gatsby&s=committer-date&type=Commits), and despite not having a “real” dedicated web developer, we’ve managed to build a fairly large site including (but not limited to):

1. Multiple “post” types — [blogs](https://liferay.design/articles) (with [tagging functionality](https://liferay.design/tags/best-practices)), [event listings](https://liferay.design/events) and recaps, [job listings](https://liferay.design/careers), [team](https://liferay.design/team/anton-juan) profiles
2. Multiple documentation-style sites — Lexicon (our design system), Blueprints (our brand style guidelines — with basic auth capability), and our department handbook
3. Landing pages — for our annual reports and most recently for our upcoming Desk Week
4. Integrating 3rd Party Data sources — like Mailchimp for our [Newsletter archive](https://liferay.design/newsletter) and Google Docs for our [career paths](https://liferay.design/handbook/grow/career-paths/individual-contributor/) and job descriptions
5. More stuff, probably

This is largely in part thanks to Gatsby’s incredible ecosystem — they really hit the sweet spot with amazing technology, thorough docs and examples, and a welcoming, helpful community.

_(apologies to Gatsby’s branding team for the above)_

Anyway, if you’re still with me and haven’t lost your lunch over my fawning yet — you’ve more than earned a decent event recap.

## The Venue

[Convene](https://convene.com/cities/los-angeles/333-south-grand-avenue) has a great space — big enough where you can fit 200+ people, but not so big where you got lost or feel isolated when you stand by yourself in a corner.

Something interesting that I had never seen before is mouthwash in a soap dispenser — [despite Linda’s earlier warning about this](https://twitter.com/LibereGatare/status/1224403652934348806), I still pumped a healthy serving of Scope into my hands.

## The Talks

_Note — there is a [complete recording of everything on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxxYParyAGk), it looks like they’ll be splitting it up into individual videos, but at the time of this posting haven’t gotten to it._

### Opening Keynote — Kyle Matthews

[Starts ~4:16](https://youtu.be/lxxYParyAGk?t=256)

Kyle began with Gatsby’s origin story, and brought that into where they are now, shared about the new release of Gatsby Cloud and then talked about the future of Gatsby.

Particularly exciting was the focus on #nocode and live demo of [blocks-ui](https://blocks-ui.com/).

He concluded with awesome shoutouts, recognizing [Rachel Cherry](https://twitter.com/bamadesigner), [Nick DeJesus](twitter.com/dayhaysoos), [Khaled Garbaya](twitter.com/khaled_garbaya), and the 25 other Gatsbytes (I learned from [Shane Thomas](https://twitter.com/smthomas3) the official way to refer to people who work at Gatsby).

### Gatsby Cloud: What’s New and What’s Coming — Dustin Schau

[Starts at ~26:37](https://youtu.be/lxxYParyAGk?t=1597)

Dustin started off his talk with a bold statement:

    We plan to make Gatsby the definitive way to build for the web.

He then put his money where his mouth was by giving a live demo improving the accessibility of his wedding website and showed off the Gatsby using Contentful as a CMS deployed with Gatsby Cloud.
