## Who Are We Looking For?

“Supposing is good, but finding out is better.” — ‍Mark Twain. Supposing is useful to generate ideas, but research leads us to validate or refute these ideas; leads us to base our designs on data, and therefore drive them to excellence.

The Design research team works closely with the product teams, driving their designs towards excellence by offering them real data on which they can base their improvements.

You will be a key player in the growth of research at Liferay. Therefore, we expect you to be highly motivated to learn and grow professionally as a researcher while making the company's research processes grow and improve. 

### Key Objectives:

- Within 30 days: you will familiarize with the company's products, services and teams, especially the Design division and product teams. You will understand our Research Department's modus operandi (methodologies, processes, tools) as well as our designer roles. You will get to know the Design team and establish professional relationships.
-  By 60 days: you will effectively use our Research Department's modus operandi. You will participate in at least two research projects in research projects that arise during that time and contribute to the analysis and presentation of results.
-  By 90 days: you will work autonomously on at least two research projects from start to finish with the supervision of a mentor. You willI identify opportunities for improvement in the research process and propose solutions. 
-  At 6 months, your accomplishments will be: working autonomously at the associate level (with the support of a mentor), supporting research functions at an appropriate level, contributing to the implementation of process improvements and demonstrating to be a reliable collaborator and a valuable member of the research team with a consistent commitment to excellence in research.
