### How did you get into design?

Since I was a child, I've always been drawn to anything visual. I was the kid who wanted everything to look "nice" (even if I didn't quite know what "nice" really meant at the time). So, when the time came to decide what to study, it was clear to me that it had to be something related to visual design and the reasoning behind why things look the way they do.

At the same time, I had a passion for computers and visual interfaces. I loved exploring how machines worked and figuring out how to create the tools and applications I enjoyed back in the days of Live Messenger, Tuenti, or Nintendogs. However, there wasn't a clear academic path that combined these two worlds, so I chose Computer Science Engineering as the best starting point.

By my third year, I was still searching for a discipline that would ignite my passion and motivate me to dedicate my life to it. That's when I discovered "Human Interface Design." From that moment on, it's been a love story ever since.

### Why are you at Liferay?

Well, it was a "manifesting" type of thing. I have been an organizer at T3chFest (a technological and science conference) since I started university, and I attended one of your meetups at the Madrid office. I was impressed with the facilities and general vibe of the place and wondered if I would get the chance to work in a company like that one day.

Little did I know that my future self would eventually get the chance!

### Favorite tool?

It has to be my MacBook + Figma combo.

### Best lifehack?

Never-ever in a carbonara mix the egg and the pasta on the pan if it's still hot. You will get scrambled egg spaghetti. And, of course, no cream!

### Where do you find #inspiration?

I have plenty of decks on Pinterest where I save things that I like. Siteinspire is my go-to choice for UI design.

### One thing you are getting better at?

Listening. And hopefully, driving.

### One misconception about Design you try to clear up?

Design is not only about how things look. It's a way of thinking and solving problems technically. A mindset.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

I might have tried to be an actor. I took Drama at school and made a couple of plays, and honestly, I enjoyed it a lot.

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

Using only tagged folders and tiles, everything is placed in order. My wallpaper is dynamic depending on the time of the day, I like the Apple FlyOver ones.

### Favorite place to visit?

Conil de la Frontera, Cadiz.

### Favorite superhero?

Batman all the way!

### Favorite hotkey?

Cmd-shift- 4-Caps. A screenshot of the portion of the screen that you want copied into your clipboard.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Care for the details and the reasoning behind every decision, ask many questions and learn to let go of your ego.

### Last book you read?

"In the Distance", by Hernan Diaz

### Most effective productivity booster?

Passion.

### Best interview question?

### Favorite quote?

Today I am wise, so I am changing myself."
