### Usage

A Multi step form is used when a major or big task has to be divided into smaller task, with the aim of letting the user breath in the process and providing them with a sense of progression.

-   Each step can have three different states: Disabled, selected, or done.
-   Use it to divide long and/or complicated tasks into smaller chunks that are easier for the user to complete.
-   Use it to guide a user through a new or unfamiliar process.
-   Use it when there is a specific sequence required to complete the form.
-   Make chunks that are not overwhelming.
-   Step names must be clear, short, and express the content below them. Use two words maximum.

A multi step form must have a minimum of two steps:

We recommend a maximum of seven steps for two key reasons:

-   Seven is an easy number of elements to remember
-   Seven is a good threshold for touch interaction on mobile devices

If you add more than seven steps, the remaining steps should be grouped in a dropdown menu under the sixth element in the multi step form:

A Multi step form is most commonly used to guide the user in the process of filling in a complex or long form. Some processes may require you to navigate backwards through the process. For those cases, make sure to set up links in the multi step form elements.

### Mobile

Due to the reduced space on mobile displays, the process bar is condensed to a maximum of five steps. The remaining steps are included in a dropdown that is always placed under the second to last step:
