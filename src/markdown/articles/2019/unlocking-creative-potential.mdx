_As the end of the year approaches, we often take this time to participate in our company's volunteering program. This year was no exception! Over the next few weeks, we'll be sharing a 5-part series documenting our first-ever team effort._

_If you have any ideas for a catchy program name, please do [let us know](https://twitter.com/liferaydesign)!_

_Some ideas we've been throwing around:_

- _Design for Life(ray)_
- _Liferay Design for Good_
- _Design Center for Kids Who Want To Read Good_
- _Liferay Designs it Forward_

_...your suggestions are most welcome._


## Liferay EVP

As a company, our mission is to:

> make technology useful, helping people to reach their full potential to serve others
>
> <cite>
> 	<a href="https://www.liferay.com/company/our-story">Liferay.com/our-story</a>
> </cite>

The primary way we do that is by making software — but, like many trendy companies, we also have an employee volunteering program _(Liferay EVP — yes, we are great at naming)_.

In the past, many designers have participated in things like disaster relief, homeless shelters, and other community initiatives. 

This year, we put our heads together and thought it would be great if there was a nonprofit organization that could use some help with things that **we have some level of professional expertise in**.

## About the Organization

Underground Writing serves at-risk communities in the greater Seattle area in Washington by providing a creative workshops exposing people to the power that reading and writing can have to improve their lives and communities.

> We are a literature-based creative writing program serving migrant, incarcerated, recovery, and other at-risk communities in northern Washington through literacy and personal transformation.

Their founder, Matt Malyon _(rhymes with 'Stallion')_ was working with an organization that one of our designers had previously volunteered with. At the time, he had been working on UW as a side project, but was considering moving to work on it full time — which he did at the beginning of 2019.

_An exciting aspect about working with Underground Writing, aside from an ability to directly impact underserved people, is that it was our first **all-remote** volunteering project!_

## About the Work

_After an initial discovery call, we learned that there were 4 areas that we could focus on:_

### Tech Stack

UW is currently using a few different SaaS products (Zoho, Dropbox, probably others) — we’ll have the opportunity to set them up with Google Apps for Business using Google’s free-for-nonprofit option, as well as uncover new opportunities as we go.

</div>

### Branding

They have a logo they really love, but didn't really have anything else as far as a documented brand. We aimed to provide more documentation around their brand to start, there’s a lot of other opportunities here, but we ended up prioritizing infrastructure for our first foray with them.

### Website

[Undergroundwriting.org](https://undergroundwriting.org) was originally a Squarespace site that Matt put together. It was quite limited and he wasn't able to prioritize a custom site, so we built him one in Webflow.

<Image src="/images/posts/2019-evp/intro-website.jpg" margin="2rem 0" caption="Undergroundwriting.org before we began the project." />

It was a tall task, there were a number of integrations and features — Donorbox, Mailchimp, a storefront, and a podcast — we definitely had our work cut out for us there, but our team rose to the challenge.

### Service Design

We saw a huge opportunity to connect their workshops, students, teachers, and administrators to their website via their tech stack.

Instead of a manual, time-consuming process filling out spreadsheets and uploading to Dropbox, if they could do it all through the website or using Google Forms, it would be a huge benefit to them.

## Coming Up...

In Part 2, we'll take a look at how we approached and executed on making changes to an organization's IT infrastructure. It's gonna be great!
