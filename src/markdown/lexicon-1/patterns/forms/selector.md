## Selector

Selectors are frequently used as a part of forms. This elements are used when we need to select one or more within several options. These options are displayed in the button once selected.

### Usage

This pattern is completely different from a dropdown as a selector is a native element with a list asociated. A dropdown instead opens a panel where the panel could contain multiple different things.
