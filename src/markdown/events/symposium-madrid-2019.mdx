_This year's Symposium in Madrid was an extra-special event &mdash; in addition to celebrating Liferay's 15th anniversary, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of our Spanish Symposium._

## The Venue

Customers, partners, developers, and Liferayers from Spain descended on Madrid for this two-day event. We hosted around 650 attendees in the Goya Theater, an amazing space in Madrid's Latina district, on the banks of the Manzanares river that winds through the southern part of the city.

A huge part of what made the event such a success was the work put in by the marketers who planned the event. Working closely with our Communication Designers to define everything down to the most minute detail.

[Rachel](/team/yuan-rachel) has been leading the design work for the Spanish Symposium for close to five years from our office in Los Angeles &mdash; this year we also had [Marleny](/team/francisco-marleny) join our team in the nick of time. She took on much of the work this year &mdash; and did an amazing job.

## Should Designers Speak?

We believe it's very important that designers do things that make them uncomfortable &mdash; like public speaking. In our office here in Spain, the designers are an integral part of the product development team. As such, they deserve their share of the spotlight.

This year, we had two Product Designers share:

### Empowering Business Users to Create Websites

[Juan Anton](/team/anton-juan) and Jürgen Kappler, from Engineering, shared the stage in a riveting presentation, demonstrating the full power of Modern Site Building in Liferay 7.2.

### Optimizing Digital Experiences with A/B Testing

[Susana Vazquez](/team/vazquez-susana) (pictured at the beginning of the post) and her counterpart in Engineering, David Arqués, showed off an exciting new feature that is both part of our core product, and [our recent analytics offering](/articles/2019/is-now-the-right-time-for-redesign/).

## #2020Vision

This might be the first time you've seen this hashtag &mdash; but I assure you that it definitely won't be the last. After a few weeks of well-deserved rest, the marketing team has already begun planning for next year's Symposium &mdash; we're all very excited to see them top this one!
