### Variations

Nav can be use either for horizontal or vertical navigation structures. This page shows different simple use cases of this pattern that will be applied in a bit more complex patterns such us [navbar](../navbar).

#### Vertical
A vertical navigation can be simple or it can be nested, where some of the entries could have interior levels of navigation.

In a nested navigation usually the first level opens the second. Levels that open interior levels must be always identified with a disclosure arrow that indicates this action.

It is possible to nest as many levels as you want in a nested navigation but we encourage to use a maximum of two nested levels.

#### Horizontal
A nav can be also configured in horizontal for different purposes as can be the [navbar](../navbar).
