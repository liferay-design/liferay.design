### Usage

Header is always fixed to the top of the window.

The Header is used on almost every page in the system. The most common configuration is shown below:
* Left area: Used for actions such as triggering the side menu and back navigation
* Center area: Used for the page or application title and help
* Right area: 
    * Actions. These are identified with an icon when possible and listed inside a kebab menu when an icon is not clear.These actions are application level actions.
    * User Sticker. It allows to display different options to which the user has access.

The Header can have different configurations, as you can see in the examples below.


### Examples

#### Application header

The application title always appears in the header (Web Content in this example). The title remains in the header until the user navigates to a detail page or the user has finished configuring the asset. Related actions for the application may appear on the right side. At the end of the right side, it appears the user sticker.
