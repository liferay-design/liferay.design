### Can you share a fun fact about yourself?

I've always been a pizza lover. On one visit to New York in 2009, I came to Spain with the idea of learning how to make the best possible pizza at home. So, I started to look around different forums, looking for recipes, learning about kinds of flours, temperatures, days of fermentation, etc. So, I started to try different things and also created a blog about how to make great pizza at home, (right now this blog is offline) but I still feel excited about the idea. My daughter is gluten and milk intolerant, so now I'm learning how to make the best non-dairy and free gluten pizza at home :D
