Components that are essential to build interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's look and feel is based on the combination our foundations. Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire system. In our case, these components are implemented by [Clay](https://clayui.com/).

Some of the components you will find are buttons, text inputs, alerts or tabs among others. A full knowledge about them will allow you to create bigger organisims. Some of these organisims are inside Lexicon, like tables. Others are not supported but can be found in [Satellites section](../satellite-components)
