## #des-wip

Knowing what our design colleagues are working on can be tricky as we are many designers working for different areas and timezones. To help with this, we have a slack channel **#des-wip** that we can use to share our work.

## Purpose

The goal of this channel is to communicate in a brief way what projects we are working on and improve visibility and future collaboration. **The purpose here is not feedback oriented.** If there is a case where you want to give/get feedback, there are other design specific channels for that, like #des-dxp, #des-internal, #d-product-design, #d-comm-design, #t-lexicon or just DM the person directly.

## How-to

You just need to choose one work you want to share with your colleagues and post it in the channel by following  the message-structure you will find there.

## Structure

1. Project title & status.
2. Problem statement.
3. Solution/hypothesis statement.
4. Solution screenshot or recording. “Before & After” screenshots can be useful.
5. Link or prototype (optional)

## Frequency

Every designer should post every 2 weeks.
