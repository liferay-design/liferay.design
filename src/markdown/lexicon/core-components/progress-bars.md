### Usage

Progress bars are used as a feedback mechanism for system tasks. As long as the process is running, the progress bar grows continuously from 0% to 100%. Use it for system processes.

### States

#### Loading

The progress bar grows in primary color, and the label changes to reflect the completion percentage.

### Dos and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
| -- | ----- |
| Use it for processes such as a file upload. | Never use it to communicate the progress of a user in a certain set of actions. For that you need a [multi step form type](../forms/multi-step-form). |
