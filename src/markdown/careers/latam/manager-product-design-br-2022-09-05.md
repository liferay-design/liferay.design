## Who Are We Looking For?

1. **People** — take care of the team: Effectively manage designers
   1. Hire — work with the Director of Product Design to build business cases for new headcount as necessary, work cross-functionally to recruit and onboard new talent.
   2. Grow — conduct regular 1:1’s and performance reviews with direct reports, develop growth plans for teammates.

2. **Practice** — lead and deliver: Lead designers to success in cross-functional teams, contributing directly when necessary.

   2. Deliver — quickly deliver success at the application level, growing in delivering at the platform level.
   3. Improve — work with design and cross-functional leaders to continuously improve our practice.

3. **Process** — do the right thing, the right way: Contribute to improvement of best practices and SOPs.

   2. Contribute — work with the necessary people to effectively solve the problem and manage the changes required.

## About Liferay

### How Do Liferay’s Core Values Look in the Design Team?

-   **Produce excellence** — we strive to become masters in our craft, doing the right thing even if no one notices.
-   **Lead by serving** — we’re all willing to do the unglamourous work and always looking for opportunities to help others.
-   **Value people** — we listen first and believe that everyone can contribute because there is strength in diversity.
-   **Grow and get better** — we’re always learning, when we find ways to improve our designs we take them, when we make mistakes we admit, apologize, and move forward. We fail a lot, but we aren’t failures because we learn and improve.
-   **Stay nerdy** — we live and breathe design, but we also have passions outside of work — rock climbing, coffee, photography, writing — and pursue them to the n-th degree.
