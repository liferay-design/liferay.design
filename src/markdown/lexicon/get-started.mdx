### Design language

Lexicon is a design language that provides a common framework for building interfaces within the Liferay product ecosystem. It is a guide to foundations, components, patterns, and use cases that provide consistency and coherence to these products, and, ultimately, provides a satisfactory and unified experience to its users.

Lexicon is a living project, evolving and adapting over time to new and rising technologies to meet the needs of the people.

### Modular approach

Lexicon takes a modular approach to interface design. It is a cohesive system that's able to respond to the various needs of Liferay's products through a base set of components. It seeks to simplify processes, reduce production times, and above all, to provide a consistent user experience across the board.

To achieve this goal, Lexicon uses Brad Frost's Atomic Design approach to interface design: A work methodology, based on modularity, that seeks to give a more hierarchical and organized structure to the creation of interface design systems. It's a nonlinear process, organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages.

### Lexicon site

This site explains the design specs and proper usage of Lexicon's system of components for designers, developers, and overall digital creators. While it is primarily for the Liferay community, it is open to anyone who wants to use its components or make contributions or suggestions to improving it.

		<h4>Foundations</h4>
		<p>
			These are the principles that the design system is built on. Modifications to
			these principles affect the component's behavior. These include foundational
			elements such as colors, grid, and typography.

		<h4>Components</h4>
		<p>
			This section contains the common components that are essential to build
			interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's
			look and feel is based on the combination of the foundations mentioned above.
			Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire
			system. In our case, these components are implemented by <a href="https://clayui.com/">Clay</a>.

		<h4>Templates</h4>
		<p>
			Templates offer prebuilt solutions to tackle repetitive interface challenges.
			They speed up the design process, as they only require minor modifications to
			fit your use case and display your content.

		<h4>Satellites</h4>
		<p>
			These components are for the needs of specific products or applications. They
			are built using Lexicon's foundations, patterns and components. They belong to the
			product or application that created them, rather than the design system
			itself. Therefore, they are not supported in <a href="https://clayui.com/">Clay</a> and shouldn't be supported in any base implementation.

		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>
			This section showcases practical designs by UX Designers that demonstrate how components and satellites are applied to create Lexicon
			interfaces that tackle specific scenarios.
		</p>
		<p>
			The components in this site include the labels shown below, which indicate if
			the component links to its implementation or the product where you can find
			them. This lets you view the components in a real-world application and
			context.

### Implement Lexicon

Lexicon is not an implementation. It is a set of patterns, rules, and behaviors that any library can implement. Liferay's Lexicon Experience Language web implementation is [Clay](https://clayui.com/).
