Our 4 different layouts help us visually organizing the pieces of information. This helps is just the first step to allow the user consuming information in a structured way. Information architecture present in differnet components will come on top of the layout to improve the user experience.

Our layouts:

* [Cards layout](./layout-cards)
* [Form box](./layout-form)
* [Full box](./layout-full)
* [Sidebar + box](./layout-sidebar)
