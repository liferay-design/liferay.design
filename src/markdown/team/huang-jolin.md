### How did you get into design?

I’ve always loved arts and crafts since I was a child. I think it is simply just natural for me to get into the creative industry. However, it wasn’t until the pandemic when I discovered UI/UX/product design through watching Youtube videos like “A Day in My Life as a UI/UX Designer,” and I knew that this was the career for me.

### Best lifehack?

I go to bed wearing what I plan on wearing the next day (besides jeans and formal-wear of course). It saves time in the morning. No judgment, right?

Design is not just about aesthetics. Designers have to conduct research to come up with solutions through visual and contextual interactions for more effective communication of ideas in their products.

Spotify and turning off my phone.

### Best interview question?

“How did you get into UI/UI and product design?” It’s the one I personally can most easily answer.

### What keeps you up at night?

Thinking about life, space, ocean… anything that can give me an existential crisis really.
