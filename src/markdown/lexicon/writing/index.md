This guide is the common writing framework for all products within Liferay’s ecosystem. We document, recommend, and surface common writings patterns that can be found throughout our products.

Just like our design system the writing guide is a living project that will improve over time with more usage and contributions from the designers that use it.

## How to use this guide 

### Step 1

Get familiar with the principles, style, and framework sections. 

### Step 2

During the design phase, reference sections related to your work.

#### [Writing Style](./style)

Adapted from Chicago Manual of Style to modern web design standards. This section demonstrates Lexicon’s accepted usage.

* Capitalization
* Numbers
* Punctuation
* Date
* Time

#### [Common actions](../patterns/common-actions)

Defines the proper usage of common actions. 
Ie: when to use “remove” vs “delete”


#### [Common writing patterns](../patterns/common-content-patterns)

Provides best practices for writing for:
* Actions
* Links
* Lists
* Messaging
    * Bad news
    * Instructions
    * Descriptions
    * Confirmations
    * Error recovery
    * Error
* Titles
* Validations

### Step 3

During Design Reviews

* Identify and categorize buttons (actions/verbs)
    * Cross reference for proper usage against common actions.
    * Look for supporting text in titles and descriptions related to this action. 
* Identify and categorize longer texts
    * Cross reference against messaging rules in common writing patterns.
    * Cross check against the framework
