## Acronyms and Abbreviations

Per AP style, it’s best not to use acronyms or abbreviations, but that isn’t realistic for the tech industry (API, CMS, HTML and so on). When you need to use an acronym, do not use periods. When making plural, add a single lowercase s.

_Examples:_

-   SDK, CE, DXP
-   APIs, CMSs

Versus - In titles, use "vs." and in written content, spell out "versus".

_Examples:_

-   Liferay vs. Other Vendors (title)
-   The strengths of Liferay versus other vendors lie in its portal background.

## Apostrophe

For plural nouns that don’t already end in s, add an apostrophe and an s (’s) to the end of the word. For nouns (singular or plural) that already end in s, just add an apostrophe.

_Examples:_

-   Arkansas’ legislature
-   The witness’ testimony
-   Many businesses’ services

## Colon

In a sentence, capitalize the first word after the colon if what follows the colon is a complete sentence. Use a single space following the colon. Place colons outside quotation marks when used together.

_Examples:_

-   This is it: the chance we’ve been waiting for!
-   This is it: We’ll never have to work again!
-   I only remember the ending to “The Road Not Taken”: “And that has made all the difference.”

## Comma

In a list of three or more elements, separate the elements with commas, with one exception: When a conjunction (like, and or or) joins the last two elements in a series, do not include a comma before the conjunction unless one of the list items contains a second conjunction.

_Examples:_

-   He went to Larry, Harry and Jim for legal advice.
-   I had orange juice, toast, and ham and eggs for breakfast.

## Hyphen and En Dash

A hyphen is shorter (-) and is used to mean to, up to and including. It is also used to combine an adjective with multi-word proper nouns (like New York, Queen Elizabeth, Lake Baikal, and World War II). If you are unsure whether a word combination should be two words, two hyphenated words or one compound word, check the online Merriam-Webster Dictionary.

An en dash is slightly longer than a hyphen (–, or the width of a capital N) and is used for a range of numbers, dates, game scores, pages and so on.

_Examples:_

-   Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865) was president during the American Civil War (1861–1865).
-   Jim was interested in the pre-Civil War era.

In blogs, it is fine to use hyphens where en dashes should properly be used. Web pages or any marketing collateral that might be printed should use en dashes.

## Em Dash

An em dash is the longest of the three (—, or the width of a capital M). Use an em dash to set apart entire phrases from the main body of a sentence, and separate the dashes from the words that precede and follow it with a space. When a date range has no ending date, use an em dash instead.

_Examples:_

-   The last place she expected to find him — if she ever found him at all — was in the back seat of her car.
-   Mick Jagger (1943—), Brian Jones (1942–1969) and Keith Richards (1943—) were among the band’s original members.

When writing in Word, you can insert em or en dashes by going to Insert Symbols, Special Characters. They are usually the first two characters listed.

## Bullet Points

When writing a list with bullet points, capitalize the first word of each point and punctuate the ends of sentences. The exception is a list of items, such as a list of book titles, favorite foods or software features. These should still be capitalized, but with no period at the end.

_Examples:_

When traveling to the Emerald City, remember to:

-   Take friends with you.
-   Watch out for witches.
-   Avoid flying monkeys at all costs.

Sequels to The Wonderful Wizard of Oz include:

-   The Marvelous Land of Oz
-   Ozma of Oz
-   Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz

The most popular animals in song lyrics include:

-   Lions
-   Tigers
-   Bears
