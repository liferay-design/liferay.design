## Summary

Color plays a huge part in the world and influences the way people think and the decisions they make. It is a powerful tool that designers can use to speak to their audience and draw them to action. Being conscientious of the different personalities that each color holds is just as important as where they are placed in a design. 

Take a look at what these colors mean and the emotions that they evoke:

 - **Red**: _Confidence, youth, and power._

 - **Yellow**: _Happiness, optimism, and warmth._
 - **Green**: _Peace, growth, and health._
 - **Blue**: _Trust, security, and stability._
 - **Purple**: _Luxurious, creative, and wise._
 - **Black**: _Reliable, sophisticated, and experienced._
