## 👾 Getting started

### If you don't have a dev environment

Skip down to [Starting Phresh](#starting-phresh) for a step-by-step guide.

<br />

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**

    - open Terminal and type:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    - hit Enter, then do the same for the command below

1. **Start up the dev server**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Your [favorite browser](https://opera.com) should open automatically showing the site at `http://0.0.0.0:localhost:7777`!

    - It will also be accessible on your network at `your.local.ip:7777` — usually this will be something like `192.168.1.160:7777` — the command line prompt will specify your address.
    - _This makes mobile development easier, since you can check the site out on any device that's on your network._

1. See the [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for what to do after you make some improvements!

## ⛩ Structure

### 🌳 Branches

#### Master

Work and submit pull requests from the `master` branch.

#### Dev

_Note: The `Dev` branch is no longer being actively used — the use-case for it is no longer necessary thanks to [Netlify's Deploy Previews](https://app.netlify.com/sites/happy-jackson-1b6bb8/deploys?filter=deploy+previews)._

Currently live on [dev.liferay.design](https://dev.liferay.design). This is our pre-production environment, best not to send pull requests to it unless there's a special scenario.

#### Production

Currently live on [liferay.design](https://liferay.design), don't work on Production as your pull request typically won't get accepted.

#### vN

We save "versions" of the site as branches &mdash; v1 (for example) was the first ever version of the site.

TODO: deploy old versions on subdomains.

---

### 📂 Folders

#### Deploy

This contains the scripts that make the site magically appear when new work gets pulled into the repo &mdash; real developers made this for us, and we generally don't touch it.

#### src

The src folder is where all the code is that gets compiled into a `public` folder which gets rendered onto the interwebs at [our domain](https://liferay.design). We roughly follow [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) principles.

##### components

Where all of our react components live &mdash; atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and theme.

##### markdown

This is where 98.3% of the site content lives &mdash; [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a lot easier to write than html 🤓.

###### Using React Components Within a Markdown file

> This is new experimental territory to render react components in md files, so you will propbably run into some quirks!

1. Rename the file extension from `.md` to `.mdx`
2. If you have markup in the file, you will now have to make it React friendly (change `class` to `className` and `style=""` to `style={{}}`)
3. Import the component as normal and use it as normal :)

```js
---
title: 'Markdown File Title'
---

<div className="aspect-ratio card-item-first" style={{background: "url('/images/logos/liferay-logo.png') center/cover"}}>
  <Icon name="keyboardArrowDown" />
</div>
```

-   Notes: - For `.mdx` file syntax highlighting you can download the "Mdx" extension and follow their instructions - Don't put an extra line break between markup as it will think it will print out the literal markup for some reason

##### pages

Surprise surprise, this is where the code for the main pages of [liferay.design](https://liferay.design) lives.

##### theme

Stylesheets and other theme-related files.

##### utils

`generateIcons.js` will take any svg in the `static / images / icons` folder and add it to the `icons` component.

#### static/images

This is where we store all the... you guessed it, images! There's probably a better way to do this, so please help us out.

## 💁 What do all these files do?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md

1. **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for a tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby node APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

-   **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

-   **To dive straight into code samples head [to our documentation](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the “Guides”, API reference, and “Advanced Tutorials” sections in the sidebar.

## Starting Phresh

_See our [GitHub Setup Guide](https://liferay.design/handbook/work/tools/github/setup/)_

### Notes

1. **Pushing work to any of the branches will automagically build the site**
