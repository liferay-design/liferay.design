As a team, we've noticed overlap and redundancy in some of the research we're doing on a regular basis for our work in Marketing, Product Management, Engineering, Information Services, Global Services, and other groups.

[Abel Hancock](/team/hancock-abel) has spent some of his "free" time to organize and summarize past research, and create a process to systematically share future work.

Over the next days and weeks, into perpetuity, the team will be sharing brief summaries on relevant topics with curated links for further reading. If you'd like to engage in some fruitful discussions, be sure to follow [#Best Practices](/tags/best-practices) to catch them all!

A preview of some of the topics we'll be touching on: [#accessibility](/tags/accessibility) [#ResearchAndDevelopment](/tags/ResearchAndDevelopment) [#psychology](/tags/psychology) [#strategy](/tags/strategy) [#usability](/tags/usability) [#Design](/tags/Design) [#VisualDesign](/tags/VisualDesign) [#InsideEngineering](/tags/InsideEngineering) and most importantly [#BugbeeFeedback](/tags/BugbeeFeedback)
