This pattern is used in form scenarios, usually to display a form, multiple forms or a combination of single/multiple forms and one or several sheets to display information.

### Layout

There are some main elements created in order to define the form hierarchy and to present different use cases:

The following image represents a complete description of the component. Although in any of the use cases is used as displayed in this image, it helps define its elements.

1. Form sheet header. (only used in multiple-forms scenarios, ex: Commerce).
2. Sheet title.
3. Section.
    * Simple.
    * With accordion.
    * With button.
4. Secondary section (same as a section but without underline).
5. Content of any type. Example: form fields, a table, or a list.
6. Form buttons: there can be several, not just Save and Cancel (the most common).

### Variations

Although the content will normally be a form with a variable number of inputs, as a container, it can also contain a table, list, or text content.

The examples below serve as an example of use cases for the form sheet.

#### Free content

Free content allows using the sheet with any kind of content inside. Users just benefit from the sheet style that provides consistency along the platform.

A usage example can be found in Web Content.

#### Single form

Many of our admin interfaces present single form configuration. For them it is relevant to present a title, an optional description, several sections with content, and the buttons to submit the form.

An example in DXP can be found in the user form below “Users & Organizations”.

#### Multiple form

There are situations where having multiple forms is a need of the product. This usage is restricted to Commerce due to their product needs.

Multiple forms configuration forces to not have general form buttons per form sheet and a general “save” action is centralized in a single button. This action must check the status and validate each of the form sheet changes.

See Commerce product screen. In this case, you can find free content usage, display relevant product information, and several form sheets, each one to capture different product

#### Dataset content

A common usage of the sheet is to present a dataset display inside. This case benefits of the sheet title and the content free space to place elements such as the dataset display.

This usage can be found in fragments, categories, and tags, among others.

Spacing around the frame and in between sections content is 24px. Each section is spaced from the next one 48 px. Visit [Form hierarchy](/lexicon/core-components/forms/forms-hierarchy/) for more information.
