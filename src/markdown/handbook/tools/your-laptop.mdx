Below are our suggestions for how to set up your laptop for optimal portability. This setup method is designed to streamline the process for starting with a new machine or getting a fresh start with your current machine.

_Special thanks to [@Naoki Hisamoto](/team/hisamoto-naoki) for [his work](https://github.com/naoki-evan-hisamoto/phresh-n-clean) in documenting the bulk of this process._

[**Set Up**](#set-up) section will walk you through getting your phresh machine up and running as quickly as possible.

[**Application Installation**](#application-installation) section will walk you through installing your applications.

[**Tasty Treats**](#tasty-treats) section will tell you some of our Liferay team members' top picks for applications and extensions.

_Wipe your hard drive clean and install your apps quickly._

[**Preparation**](#preparation) section will prevent you from losing important files, documents, and registration keys upon reinstallation.

[**Wipe + Reinstall**](#wipe--reinstall) section will walk you through installing a phresh copy of OSX.

## Set Up

The Set Up section will walk you through getting your phresh machine up and running as quickly as possible. We will set up the computer with Homebrew, Node, NPM, Gulp, Homebrew Cask, Git, and Github. This will prepare your computer for future processes such as installing applications quickly.

_Steps 1-3 are necessary for onboarding â€” 4&5 are optional if they're interesting to you._

### 1. [Homebrew ðŸ”—](http://brew.sh)

Homebrew is a great tool for web developers. First, it makes removing Node very easy (otherwise you have to crawl through your file system and delete a bunch of files manually). Second, it greatly simplfies the installation of other useful packages like Git, Ruby, or the very useful wget utility.

1. Paste this into a Terminal prompt:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### 2. [Git + GitHub ðŸ”—](https://github.com/)

_Note: you will need to [set up a GitHub account](/handbook/tools/github/) before doing this step._

1. [Set up Git and authenticate with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
    1. Install Git by entering `brew install git` into your terminal and hitting 'enter'.
    1. [Set your username](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/).
    1. [Set your commit email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/) (use the email your GitHub account is associated with).
    1. [Cash your password inside Git](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/) (makes life easier).

### 3. [Node + NPM ðŸ”—](https://www.npmjs.com)

1. Enter `brew install node` into a Terminal prompt.
2. Enter `npm install npm@latest -g` into a Terminal prompt.
3. To check the install, enter `node -v; npm -v`. You should see two numbers print out which are the versions for node and npm respectively.

## Preparation

The Preparation section will prevent you from losing important files, documents, and application keys upon reinstalling OSX. The hard drive is completely erased during this process and taking the time to back up files and deauthorizing applications will ensure you have zero regrets after your phresh install.

### 1. Back Up

A fresh install of OS X will wipe any files, programs, and documents from your hard drive. Whether you use Time Machine, the Cloud, or an external hard drive, be sure to have a back up of anything you will need on your phresh machine. If you are using the cloud, make sure all files are finished syncing as well.

### 2. Deauthorize

Your computer will be viewed as a new machine after the phresh install, which means that you will want to deauthorize any applications that required a registration key. Otherwise, the same key will not work when registering a product after the wipe and you might have to jump through hoops to get your product license back.

## Wipe + Reinstall

The Wipe + Reinstall section will walk you through installing a phresh copy of OSX. When you are ready, you'll erase your hard drive and install the latest version of OSX. Once you are at this point, double-check that all necessary files, documents, pictures, and videos are backed up and all applications are deauthorized (as mentioned in the previous steps) because there is no going back after this step.

### 1. Wipe

You will be erasing your hard drive at this point. Once you have completed this step, your hard drive will be reformatted.

1. Make sure your computer is plugged into a power source.
2. `Restart` your computer and hold down `âŒ˜ + R` as soon as the reboot starts. If successful, you will be met by the OSX Utilities screen.
3. Select **Disk Utility**, select your **Hard Drive**.
4. Select the **Erase** tab.
5. Rename your Hard Drive, select the [format](https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/erase-a-volume-dskutl14079/mac) of your Hard Drive, and select **Erase**.
6. Once the drive has been formatted, exit out of Disk Utility to return to the OSX Utilities screen.

### 2. Reinstall

Now that you have a reformatted hard drive, you will be installing a phresh copy of the latest OSX onto your hard drive (Unless you have the installation files for a different OS version on a flash drive).

1. Make sure your computer is plugged into a power source.
2. From the OSX Utilities screen select **install macOS**.
3. Select the hard drive you just reformatted in step 3 of the previous section.
4. Select **Install** and select your preferences as prompted.
