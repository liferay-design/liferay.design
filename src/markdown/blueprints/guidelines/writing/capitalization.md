## Titles of People and Terms Within Text

### People

Capitalize a person’s title only when it’s used directly before a name. This rule includes government positions (like president, senator, mayor, ambassador, chief justice) and other organizational positions (like chair, treasurer, general manager).

_Examples:_

-   President Obama
-   General Manager Linda Pule
-   Is the mayor here yet?

### Terms

Within sentences, don’t capitalize topics or terms that are common to the software space such as portal, digital experience platform, customer service, marketing analytics, content management, etc. These aren’t proper nouns and don’t need to be capitalized.

_Examples:_

-   Digital experience platforms include tools for content management, marketing analytics and customer service.
-   Liferay provides user profiles, content management and documents to all digital touchpoints.

## Titles of Published Assets

_Always use title case._

-   Capitalize the first and last words, regardless of the length of the word or the part of speech.
-   Capitalize all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and pronouns, regardless of the length of the word.
-   Capitalize prepositions of four or more letters (like over, from and with).
-   Capitalize conjunctions of four or more letters (like unless and than), as well as if, how and why.

_Don’t capitalize:_

-   Articles (a, an and the).
-   Prepositions of three or fewer letters (such as of, in and for).
-   Most conjunctions of three or fewer letters (like as, and, or and but).
-   The “to” in the infinitive form (e.g., to Blog).

_Examples:_

-   “Omnichannel: More Than a Buzzword for Banks”
-   “Top 5 Things to Do With Your First Liferay Bundle”

### Branded Lowercase Proper Nouns

If the first word in a title is a proper noun that begins with a lowercase letter (like iPhone), try to reorder the title so that you can capitalize the name as the company or person usually does. If such a noun falls elsewhere in the title, use the company’s capitalization style.

_Example:_

-   “How the iPhone Is Changing Digital Business.”

### Numbers in Titles

[See section on Numbers.](/blueprints/guidelines/writing/numbers/)

### Hyphenated Words in Titles

If a hyphenated word appears in title-style capitalization, capitalize the first word and capitalize all words in the compound except for articles (a, an and the), prepositions of three or fewer letters (like to and of) and coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet and so). Ask yourself: If this word weren’t hyphenated, would I capitalize it? If the answer is yes, capitalize it as part of the hyphenated word, too.

_Examples:_

-   Tips for Seamless Back-End Integration
-   Out-of-the-Box Features in Liferay DXP

## Company and Product Names

Follow an organization’s conventions for how it capitalizes and punctuates its names. Many organizations (e.g., FedEx) use capital letters in the middle of the name. Other organizations (e.g., Yahoo!) use punctuation characters in their names. Check their website or press releases and use whatever they have there.

## Pronouns Referring to Companies

When referring to another company, use the third-person singular pronouns it and its, not they or their. In the U.S., a company is treated as a collective noun and requires a singular verb and a singular pronoun.

_Example:_

-   Carrefour used Liferay to boost its productivity.

When referring to Liferay, use we, our, etc.

_Examples:_

-   Liferay can support your digital marketing efforts with our industry-leading software.
-   Harness the innovation of our open source community.

## Capitalization on Liferay Web Pages

### Headers

If a header is a complete sentence, capitalize and punctuate as a sentence.

_Example:_
Engage users throughout the entire customer journey.

If a header is a fragment, treat it as a title.

_Examples:_

-   What Comes With Your Subscription
-   Management, Tooling and Third-Party Apps

Subheaders should be capitalized and punctuated as titles, regardless of whether they’re complete sentences.

_Examples:_

-   Agile Development
-   Go Beyond Managing Content
-   We’ve Seen It Before

### Buttons

Text should be capitalized and punctuated as a title.

_Examples:_

-   Start My Free Trial
-   Show Me Liferay
-   Download Now

### Links

Link text should be capitalized and punctuated as a title, unless the link is incorporated into a longer piece of written content (e.g., a sentence in the middle of a paragraph that makes sense whether the link is included or not).

_Examples:_

-   Learn More About Subscriptions >
-   Check out our product page to learn more about subscriptions.

### Field Text in Forms

Text should be capitalized and punctuated as a title (e.g., Email, First Name).
