### Usage

Tooltips are used in with icon buttons to help understanding the metaphor they transmit.
They can be also used with links or images.

The tooltip appears on hover state and disappears when hover ends. This pattern does not exist in mobile a hover is not a possible state.

Please make a right use of the arrow positioning as it could drive to misunderstandings when it doesnâ€™t point to the correct interface element.
