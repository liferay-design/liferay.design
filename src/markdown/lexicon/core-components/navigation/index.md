Navigation in a product can be present in differnet ways. It can show hierarchy, like a [breadcrumb](./breadcrub.html) does. It can be present in menus, usually [vertically](.vertical-nav.html). Or even in dedicated [bars](.horizontal-nav.html) for navigation that at same time help spliting an application into smaller modules.
