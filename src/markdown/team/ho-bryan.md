### Why are you at Liferay?

Why aren’t you? There are some cool people here.

### Favorite tool?

Pen tool.

### Best lifehack?

To make a better mac & cheese at souplantation, you add the extra cheese, some bacon and a little sour cream into a soup bowl. Then you add the M&C and dust with parmesan. Oh, you mean a design hack? Learn to use cmd+D.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

‘Ahh ha moments’ may be few and far in-between, but work based on your instincts and skills and they’ll reveal themselves to you rather than materialize out of thin air.

Cold brew and the first track of the Hamilton soundtrack, Alexander Hamilton.

### What keeps you up at night?

Bad Designers.
