_Jira is Liferay's primary project management tool. Many teams and departments have their own Jira projects — we've created our own guide to help Designers work in our project._
## Bringing all design teams together

By tracking and managing our work in a single project, we're able to use resources and workflows more efficiently.

Our Jira project is called [DESIGN](https://issues.liferay.com/projects/DESIGN/summary) - there are one or more [boards](https://issues.liferay.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=5797&projectKey=DESIGN) for each team.

Note that many designers also work in other Jira projects outside of DESIGN — for example, all of Liferay's products have their own projects ([LPS](https://issues.liferay.com/projects/LPS/), [LRAC](https://issues.liferay.com/projects/LRAC/), etc). 

The DESIGN project was created due to current demands from:

- Communication Design *formerly COMMDES*
- Design Research *formerly DESRES*
- Lexicon *formerly LEXICON*

As well as new requests from the Solutions and Operations teams.

Long story short — we moved into a single project for increased efficiency, reducing maintenance, and increasing our ability to gather data.

There are also many secondary benefits — such as an increased awareness for what kinds of work Design does *(someone requesting work from Product Design can see that we also do research)* and a reduced cognitive load for people requesting work from Design *(people no longer need to remember which Design project to start an issue in)*.
