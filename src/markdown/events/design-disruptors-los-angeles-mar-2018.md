## Brief Summary

Invision was kind enough to allow us to host an exclusive screening of their documentary "Design Disruptors". I believe we were only the second screening in Los Angeles!

### Film Synopsis From Invision

> _Our future is designed._

> _DESIGN DISRUPTORS is a full-length documentary featuring design leaders and product designers from 15+ industry-toppling companies—valued at more than 1 trillion dollars combined._

> _The film chronicles the true nature of design and the design-driven business revolutions being shaped around the world through the designers eyes._

> _Get a never-before-seen look into the perspectives, processes, and design approaches of leaders at industry-toppling brands and discover how these companies are disrupting billion dollar industries through design._

## Biggest Takeaways

The film did a great job explaining what Design is, the importance of it, and how some of the best designers are creating success in their organizations. Some highlights:

-   Art ≠ Design
-   "Everything is designed. Not everything is designed well"
-   "If we’re not thinking about diversity, then we’re not thinking about people."

## Special Thanks

We really appreciate InVision for letting us share this film with our team and community, it was a great educational experience for all and definitely started lots of great conversations!
