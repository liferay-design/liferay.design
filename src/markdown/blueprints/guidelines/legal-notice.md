## Global Responsibility

It’s our responsibility to make every effort to protect Liferay’s intellectual property and corporate image. If you see potential infringement or misuse, please report it on [Legal's Trademark Misuse Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedw6cbBaY9Sqhyd4_qOM08g3Kzuk-Ss0b_ZhARhjXkm-WgDQ/viewform).

## Trademarks

Our trademarks serve as an important part of our business communications, maintain the integrity of Liferay’s image and help to clearly differentiate our Liferay brand.

Liferay has registered its trademarks or otherwise sought protection in the United States, Europe and in other countries. Legal rights carried by trademarks vary depending on the country in which the mark is registered and used. In the U.S., the symbol ® means the trademark is registered and lawfully protected from use by a third party. The use of trademarked product names with the correct designation strengthens Liferay’s brand name and makes our rights more enforceable.

## Copyrights

Indicated by the symbol ©, copyrights protect our exclusive rights of creations conveyed via a fixed medium, such as paper, film, and computer disks. Third parties must always obtain permission from Liferay when reproducing or using the material. We highly recommend using the © for protection on all materials distributed outside the company.

For more information on copyrights, see our internal [Liferay Outbound Licensing Policy](https://grow.liferay.com/excellence/Liferay+Outbound+Licensing+Policy) and our internal [FOSS in Liferay](https://grow.liferay.com/excellence/foss+in+liferay) landing page.
