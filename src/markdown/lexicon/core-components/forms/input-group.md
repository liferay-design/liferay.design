### Layout

The layout of a Text Input is flexible, allowing for the addition of elements on either side of the field.

Usually, the components placed around the Text Input are Buttons, Split Buttons, and/or help labels. Help labels clarify values such as currency, unit of measurement, digits, email addresses, etc.
