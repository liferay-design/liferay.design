## Summary

Remote and in-person usability tests are similar, with one key difference: the participant and facilitator aren't in the same geographical location.

## Remote usability testing:

-   Allows you to conduct user research with participants in their natural environment.
-   Doesn’t require the participant or the facilitator to travel.
-   Is great for testing products whose users are geographically dispersed.
-   Requires employing screen-sharing software or online remote usability tools.

Both remote and in-person usability tests can be moderated or unmoderated.

## Moderated remote testing:

-   Participants are observed and interacted with while they complete the tasks for the test.
-   Best for complex tasks that don’t have a structured sequence of steps or where more interaction and questioning will benefit testing.

## Unmoderated remote testing:

-   User must perform the task without the intervention of the moderator.
-   More effective when it comes to simple tasks that want to answer specific questions about product functionality.

## Takeaway

The objective of the task, the type of user required, and its geographical location will determine the type of test: traditional or remote, moderated or unmoderated.

In both moderated and unmoderated tests it is important to be available to address possible problems that may occur.
