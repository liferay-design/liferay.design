### Usage

#### When should I use the default animations?

There are three default [animations](../foundations/animations) available to communicate empty states. The scenario for each empty state and animation is shown below:

**Empty dataset:** There are no elements in the data set at a certain level

**Empty search results:** The filters or search results return zero results.

**Empty state for success:** The user has emptied the dataset for a good cause. For example, all the notifications have been addressed, resulting in a clean state.

#### When not to use an animation

Animations are used to catch the user's attention, therefore they should only appear once on the screen. In our case, we use these animations in the components that are usually the center of attention and receive the most focus. In less common components, we prefer to avoid the animation and be more discrete.

### Attributes

#### Inside a dataset display

These attributes are used for an animation:

1. Animation
2. Text: limited to one line
3. Message: limited, but we recommend to use a maximum of 30 words
	* Do not make messages personal, unless they are preferable for the context.
	* Do not leave one word alone on a line.
	* Do not use "your".
	* Do not use exclamation marks.
	* Use common language and not jargon.
4. Button: secondary button

The margin from the container to the top element is 80px.

#### Outside a dataset display

Animations shouldn't be used outside a dataset display. In these cases, use a primary button to catch the user's attention. The primary button has these attributes:

1. Text: limited to one line
2. Message: This follows the same rules as an animation's message.
3. Button: A small primary button
