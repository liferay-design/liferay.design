### Usage

Breadcrumb works the same way across all viewport sizes. When there isn't enough space on the screen to display all the breadcrumbs, the first levels are collapsed into a dropdown menu. This allows the user to read and navigate to the previous closer levels, and also lets them navigate to other levels easily.

-   The breadcrumb is always horizontal.
-   Long crumbs can be reduced using ellipsis.
-   All crumbs link to their respective navigation level, except the last crumb which is only used to identify the current page.
-   When the crumbs reach overflow on the screen, the elements get collapsed into a dropdown menu as shown below. The order of the elements inside the dropdown menu is reversed.
