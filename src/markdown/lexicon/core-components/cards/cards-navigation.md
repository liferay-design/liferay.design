### Usage

This card is simple containing just a minimalistic image or icon, title and possible short description.

Navigation card is thought to visually repensent concepts but not to display images that contain lot of information.

You can find it in two formats:

-   Big: for those cases where you want to highlight more relevant access points
-   Small: for secondary access points
