This section describes the main navigational patterns, although more patterns are available.

Product navigation in DXP DE is always done through the [product menu](../Sidebar/product_menu.html). This sidebar acts as side navigation pattern and is always placed on the left side of the screen. It can be displayed or hidden with the product menu icon.

Page navigation can have different compositions but it always follows a same pattern:

1. Header (mandatory): Displays the application name
	1. Product menu button
	2. Page / Application name
	3. Application actions such as Export/Import or Permissions
2. Application sections: Only use sections if the application has more than one section
