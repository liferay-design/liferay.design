### Usage

Rather than provide a complete interactive wizard display as the multi step form does, the simplified multi step form guides the user through a task in a light way by simply displaying text that indicates the user's progress.

-   This simplified version is not interactive and only informative.
-   It's most commonly used in modals that have a process with several steps.
-   The left side is reserved for the step name.
-   The right side is reserved for the step number, which must always indicate the current step number out of the total number of steps.
