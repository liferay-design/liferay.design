**Summary** – Which is more productive: testing five users or five hundred?

Jacob Nielsen answers, “The best results come from testing no more than 5 users and running as many small tests as you can afford. \[...\] Testing with 5 people lets you find almost as many usability problems as you'd find using many more test participants”.

Let’s look at the numbers:

-   First, run a usability test with 5 users — this usually detects 85% of your design problems.
-   A second test with 5 more users can identify the remaining 15% of your design’s usability problems.

Below you can see the table in which Nielsen shows the percentage of problems detected as the number of users tested increases.

**Takeaway** – The giant, Google, has promoted Usability Testing with no more than 5 users in the design of their applications — the same ones that we use daily here in Liferay.
