## _Based in Los Angeles, but open to remote candidates in North American time zones._

Liferay’s core product and services teams are looking for a designer to create engaging experiences in business critical functions. Some of the recent projects that the Search team has worked on include designing an interface for admins to customize and users to interface with intelligent search suggestions. The Provisioning team handles licensing and subscriptions for Liferay customers — arguably one of the most important business functions at Liferay. Second only to possibly Support, where you’ll also contribute by working on our [Help Center](https://help.liferay.com).

## What do I need to succeed?

In addition to a strong foundation in core design skills — type, color, layout — a background, or at least a demonstrable passion for these skills is necessary:

1. **Empathetic interaction** <br/>
   One of the things these three teams has in common is that they all require a deep knowledge of the wide variety in our customer personas. From highly technical IT administrators to non-technical business users and everyone in-between — you’re an active listener and your designs show it.
2. **Organization** <br/>
   You are meticulous and thorough — from planning to execution — juggling multiple projects is not easy, but you are able to make it look that way.
3. **Collaboration** <br/>
   You can drive consensus and compromise without sacrificing business goals because your work is well considered and supported by strong evidence gained from a deep understanding of the end user.

## What will help me stand out?

1. **Design research** <br/>
   Did we mention that this role requires a deep understanding of a variety of people? Having a background in research and experience in a variety of methods would be very helpful.
2. **Business acumen** <br/>
   Having a good understanding of business principles is great, if you know how an enterprise business operates, even better!
3. **Technical chops** <br/>
   We are a company founded by engineers, and developers are still one of our biggest customers, so a background or familiarity with engineering is a plus.

## What do I need to apply?

1. Link to your website that includes recent, relevant case studies
2. Cover letter (nothing formal!) with 3-5 sentences about a company you think is doing a really great job with customer support and why.

## Cover letter? Do you really read them?

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
