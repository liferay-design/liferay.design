### Dos and Don'ts

<br />

1. Use the same height for all the buttons that are in the same row.

<Grid variant='smallCards' >
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonSizeDo.png"
				alt="two buttons of same height in a row"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</Box>
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonSizeDont.png"
				alt="two buttons of different height in a row"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</Box>
</Grid>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

2. Characters can not all be uppercase in a button.

<Grid variant='smallCards' >
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonCapitalizationDo.png"
				alt="button with no caps lock"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</Box>
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonCapitalizationDont.png"
				alt="button with caps lock"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</Box>
</Grid>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

3. Text can not wrap multiple lines. It must all be on one line.

<Grid variant='smallCards' >
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonWrapDo.png"
				alt="button with text on one line"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</Box>
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonWrapDont.png"
				alt="button with text wrapped"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</Box>
</Grid>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

4. A borderless button must be placed either before or after a set of bordered buttons.

<Grid variant='smallCards' >
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonIconDo.png"
				alt="borderless button, secondary button, primary button"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</Box>
	<Box>
		<div class="image-container">
			<img
				src="/images/lexicon/ButtonIconDont.png"
				alt="secondary button, borderless button, primary button"
			/>
		</div>
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</Box>
</Grid>

<br />

### Variations

#### Secondary borderless

A secondary borderless button is used in toolbars when a secondary button would be too heavy for the toolbar's design. This keeps the design clean.

![button secondary borderless default size default state](/images/lexicon/ButtonBorderless.png)

#### Icon button

Buttons can display icons instead of text. The icons, however, must be monospaced inside the button. Icon buttons are used primarily in [management bars](../toolbars/management-bar). This button variation can be primary, secondary, or borderless type.

![button icon secondary default size default state](/images/lexicon/ButtonIconSecondary.png)

![button icon secondary boderdeless default size default state](/images/lexicon/ButtonIconBorderless.png)

#### Icon and text button

This button type is only used in sites, outside of administration. The icon emphasizes and helps communicate the action. The label must match the icon's purpose.

![button with icon and text](/images/lexicon/ButtonIconText.png)

#### Block level button

Buttons can also be configured at block level. Use this configuration when you need to communicate that an important action is required for the user. For example, it can be used as a load more action below a list. Please do not use it in forms. Choose the button type carefully. Primary is not always the best choice, nor is it the only configuration.

#### Dropdown button

Dropdown buttons are always used with a dropdown menu. This button variation can be secondary or borderless type.

#### Split button

Split buttons are used when you need to offer the user a quick main action along with secondary actions.

![button group where the left button specifies the main action and the second one displays a dropdown menu with secondary actions](/images/lexicon/ButtonSplit.png)

#### Button group

Button groups are used to switch between complementary views for example, but they must never be used for complementary actions, "Change and Cancel" actions, or "Save and Cancel" actions. In those cases, single buttons are the correct solution.

![button group, two examples. First one without disabled button, second one with disabled button](/images/lexicon/ButtonGroup.png)

#### Plus button

Plus buttons provide add actions for a dataset and are normally placed in toolbars. The add button lets you add entities, such as a blog post for a blog, a message board thread for a message board, or a folder. It can have one action or multiple. Visit Dropdown menu > Sorting actions to learn more.

#### Action button

Action buttons are used when a set of contextual actions are needed for an element or a dataset. This button displays a set of actions inside a dropdown menu. The actions must be sorted in a specific way. please visit Dropdown menu > Sorting actions to learn more.
