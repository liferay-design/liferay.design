_A foundational piece of [organizational culture](https://www.managementstudyguide.com/importance-of-organization-culture.htm) is shared values — Liferay’s core values are fairly recently published[^1] and for them to take root and be effective, they need to be [woven into everything](https://hbr.org/2002/07/make-your-values-mean-something)._

_As we discussed the core skills that we want to see in the Design Department, we asked ourselves how do our company values shape the way we work? How are they manifested in our evaluations and growth? How do we advance and promote these values?_

_While Liferay’s Core Values don’t map 1:1 with traditional Design skills, there are commonalities we wanted to articulate in order to contribute to the maturation of Liferay’s Core Values and the legitimization of our department’s core skills._
