### Design language

Lexicon is a design language that provides a common framework for building interfaces within the Liferay product ecosystem. It is a guide to foundations, components, patterns, and use cases that provide consistency and coherence to these products, and, ultimately, provides a satisfactory and unified experience to its users.

Lexicon is a living project, evolving and adapting over time to new and rising technologies to meet the needs of the people.

### Modular approach

Lexicon takes a modular approach to interface design. It is a cohesive system that's able to respond to the various needs of Liferay's products through a base set of components. It seeks to simplify processes, reduce production times, and above all, to provide a consistent user experience across the board.

To achieve this goal, Lexicon uses Brad Frost's Atomic Design approach to interface design: A work methodology, based on modularity, that seeks to give a more hierarchical and organized structure to the creation of interface design systems. It's a nonlinear process, organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages.

### Lexicon site

This site explains the design specs and proper usage of Lexicon's system of components for designers, developers, and overall digital creators. While it is primarily for the Liferay community, it is open to anyone who wants to use its components or make contributions or suggestions to improving it.

        <h4>Foundations</h4>
        <p>These are the principles that the design system is built on. Modifications to these principles affect the component's behavior. These include foundational elements such as colors, grid, and typography.</p>

        <p>This section contains the common components that are essential to build interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's look and feel is based on the combination of the foundations mentioned above. Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire system. In our case, these components are implemented by [Clay](https://clayui.com/).</p>

### Implement Lexicon

Lexicon is not an implementation. It is a set of patterns, rules, and behaviors that any library can implement. Liferay's Lexicon Experience Language web implementation is [Clay](https://clayui.com/).
