### Usage

-   Modals can be built with different sizes and configurations to best fit the amount of content you have.
-   We recommend that you do not use the full-width size, as it appears as though it's a completely new page. If you require this size, we recommend that you consider creating a new page instead of a modal.
-   Modals belong to a screen, therefore a modal should not be triggered from another modal window (see the Modal over modal section below).
-   When a modal has a footer, place the actions inside and align them to the left. Follow this order for your actions: Primary button (only one), secondary button, and button link.

| Do | Don't |
| -- | ----- |
| Use it to draw the user's attention to something that is more important. | Do not use it for complex cases that require you to display a lot of information or to complete a long form. In these cases, use a new page instead. |
| Use it for simple content cases. | Try not to trigger a modal window from another modal window. Modal windows are subordinate to pages. |
| Use it if you need to interrupt the user flow to display concrete information or capture data from the user. | Never completely cover the page's information with the modal window. |

#### Multiple selection inside a modal

Selecting multiple items in a modal must be done by selecting each desired element through the checkbox. The selection will be finished by clicking in Done button at the modal footer.

![multiple selection from a table inside a modal is done by selecting elements and clicking in Done button to complete the selection](/images/lexicon/Modal-selection-multiple.jpg)

#### Single selection inside a modal

Single selection must be done by clicking directly on the desired element. In this case, the element must not have a Choose or Select button. The modal doesn't have footer as there is no need.

#### Modal over modal

Modal over modal is a not desired situation. Please, try to solve this situation in another way, like using a full page or driving the process to the correct place. In case this happens, make sure to provide a good experience preventing first modal closing by accidental interaction (as an example).

### Size

Modals are always displayed at the center of the screen and can be configured with the sizes shown in the table below:

| Size       | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small      | 320px                                                                                                          |
| Default    | 600px                                                                                                          |
| Large      | 896px wide modal on screen sizes greater than 992px. 600px wide modal on screen sizes between 768px and 992px. |
| Full width | A modal that stretches to fit the browser window, with 45px padding on every side.                             |

### Configurations

Lexicon allows your modal window to have different configurations related to your needs. These needs vary from case to case and that is why not every modal in the system needs to be equal, but needs to follow certain rules.

#### Header, body and footer

This is the classic composition of a modal window with its three main parts: header, body, and footer.

![modal window over a dark transparent background](/images/lexicon/Modal.jpg)

#### Header and body

This configuration is used when you don't need a footer bar to place your icons.

![modal window over a dark transparent background only header and body](/images/lexicon/ModalFooterless.jpg)

#### Body and Footer

Use this configuration when you just need to show text and buttons to agree or cancel.

![modal window over a dark transparent background only body and footer](/images/lexicon/ModalBodyFooter.jpg)

#### iframe in the body

You can of course add an iframe to a modal body at any time. See the iframe modal body [Clay](https://clayui.com/docs/components/modals.html) section for more information.

#### Modal overlay color

The modal overlay color is a main lighten 8% color with an alpha value of 0.8.

#### Modals for status messages

Modal headers can be configured to use modals as status messages. This solution is proposed to give more emphasis on blocking actions that the use must read and pay careful attention.

Never remove the icon in the title, as it provides the modal with a better user experience for accessibility.

Always use direct and concrete titles.

### Mobile

When a modal is viewed on a mobile device, its look and feel transforms to the one shown below to provide a mobile friendly user experience. The modal occupies the whole screen, drawing the user's attention.
