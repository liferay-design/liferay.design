### What is accessibility?

Accessibility is designing your product or site so that everyone can access it equally, regardless of visual impairment or other physical impairment or disability.

### Why should you provide accessible interfaces?

Your product or site should be designed with everyone in mind. Accessibility is one of the main concerns of Liferay, therefore, Lexicon's system is designed with this in mind.

Accessibility brings independence to people with disabilities. It offers the same range of possibilities to users with different physical problems. Remember that all your users are equally important.

Accessibility may also be a legal requirement for your business. Some countries have strict regulations on accessibility, and they may enforce standards, which vary depending on the country, that you must follow. Some of these standards are listed below:

-   [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag)
-   [Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act](https://www.section508.gov/section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act)
