## Biggest Takeaway

The best part of the session where not the talks, although they were pretty good. The best part was the circle created after the talk and the topics treated there. There was an intense and very good discussion. Everyone shared the status of their projects related to design systems, many companies are growing in this direction. There is a big interest in this community and talking more about different topics related to design ops.

## Lessons Learned

Setting a strong base of design tokens and transferring them to the dev side, allow a more controlled environment, more scalable and with less leak points.
