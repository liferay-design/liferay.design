## Based in Madrid, Spain

_We make a world-class platform for some of the largest enterprises out there to build dynamic and data-driven user experiences. We’re looking for a senior product designer with strong interaction skills to evolve the experience across our platform to be cohesive and seamless. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and North America that are excited to build with you._

_You will be responsible for collaborating with other product designers throughout the platform areas and providing solutions to the complex interactions and patterns they’ve discovered. You’ll also work closely with our design systems team to align on what should be in our system that we use throughout multiple products and what is specific to Liferay DXP._

_If researching and solving intricate interaction problems for a robust platform product is an exciting challenge for you to own, you’ll be a critical asset to our team._

## Who Are We Looking For?

1. Within 60 days, analyze the strengths as well as redundancies in the platform between design and code while providing potential solutions to pursue.
2. By 90 days, deliver designs to implement flexible and extensible interaction patterns and components based on the requirements gathered from product and design system teams.
3. By 180 days, validate the success of solutions you’ve designed and document guidelines to inform product teams how to use platform components and patterns in design and code.

- Experience conducting usability studies to validate and measure the outcomes of your designs.
- Solid understanding of HTML, CSS, & Javascript (React) to create flexible UI components.
- Advanced or Fluent in English to communicate with the global design team and stakeholders

- Built responsive UI components with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (React preferably)

### Language Requirement:

## About Liferay

### How Do Liferay’s Core Values Look in the Design Team?

- **Produce excellence** — we strive to become masters in our craft, doing the right thing even if no one notices.
- **Lead by serving** — we’re all willing to do the unglamourous work and always looking for opportunities to help others.
- **Value people** — we listen first and believe that everyone can contribute because there is strength in diversity.
- **Grow and get better** — we’re always learning, when we find ways to improve our designs we take them, when we make mistakes we admit, apologize, and move forward. We fail a lot, but we aren’t failures because we learn and improve.
- **Stay nerdy** — we live and breathe design, but we also have passions outside of work — rock climbing, coffee, photography, writing — and pursue them to the n-th degree.

### What Can We Offer You?

Some initiatives that we’ve recently worked in are fighting human trafficking, helping foster youth, and serving refugees.
