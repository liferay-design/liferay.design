## Design Feedback

Our primary, global method for getting designer feedback is throught the following Slack channels: [#d-product-design](https://liferay.slack.com/messages/CKETJ1DTR), [#d-comm-design](https://liferay.slack.com/messages/CKETJ1DTR), and [#t-lexicon](https://liferay.slack.com/messages/CKT3L1G58). Share early and often with your teammates across the globe!

Some ground rules:

1. **Ask questions first** — don’t immediately jump to prescribing a solution.
1. **Be relevant** — if people ask for specific feedback, ask relevant questions and give relevant feedback.
1. **Take it or leave it** — general feedback is requested and given with the understanding that it could be missing context, therefore value can vary.
1. **Set expectations** — we are a global team, there's a good chance half the people are asleep when you're asking for feedback feedback so align your expectations accordingly.
1. **Be timely** — take time out of your day to periodically check the channel and give your fellow designer some help!
