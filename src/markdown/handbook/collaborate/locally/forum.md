_Design Forum arose after months of weekly [critique sessions](.././critique#rotisserie) — for more on that, read [Paul's blog entry](/articles/2019/updates-to-rotisserie)._

In-person time is valuable — we want to take advantage of the fact that we can have a time-slot to gather in-person when necessary. Here are some things that we've found this time to be useful for:

1. **Complex problem**
*something that’s too difficult to collaborate on in Slack.*
1. **Team-building activity or necessity**
*a new process, workflow, or planning need.*
1. **Design Share**
*occasional presentation on your project progress or a milestone recap.*

## Sharing at the Forum

If you'd like to share something in your local Forum, add something to [the agenda](/forum-agenda) at least 24 hours before the scheduled meeting time.

## Forum Guidelines

Keeping in mind that our collective time is very valuable — we’ve established some guidelines:

1. **100% Optional** — if you’ve got a more important conflict like a stakeholder meeting or imminent deadline, don’t attend.
1. **Be Prepared** — make sure that you’re making the best use of the time, this can vary depending on the type of activity, but at the very least have a clear **goal**, **agenda**, **notes** and **action items**.
