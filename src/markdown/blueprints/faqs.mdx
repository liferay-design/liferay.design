## What is a brand?

This wouldn't be a proper design site without a video of Steve Jobs &mdash; this is one of the best, concise explanations of the power of a brand, an excerpt from a [longer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrZKoWgcZVg) from 1997 introducing one of the most memorable brand campaigns in recent memory.

## Aren’t brand and logo like, the same thing?

Absolutely not &mdash; a brand is [more than a logo](https://hbr.org/2011/06/a-logo-is-not-a-brand), it's part of our strategy, our culture, our voice and tone, our people &mdash; and so much more.

## I need to get/update the logo for my project/product/initiative, how do I do that?

Great question &mdash; please reach out to [Paul Hanaoka](mailto:paul.hanaoka@liferay.com) and/or [Ryan Connolly](mailto:ryan.connolly@liferay.com) and explain the strategy behind your initiative and how it fits into our greater product story.

## Do I need to order new signage? (Or booths, shirts, etc)

No &mdash; the logo and visual updates can feel significant from an internal perspective, but to our audience and the world at large it's not that dramatic. In our efforts to be good stewards of our resources, if you were planning on reusing something &mdash; great, reuse it. If you are needing to print or make something new, also great! Then use the new assets. But don't just update for the sake of updating.

## Why is everything blue?

Liferay has been doing business for close to 15 years &mdash; we have always been blue, it's the color our customers, partners, and community have come to associate us with.

## Can I get a DXP logo that is only one line in height?

Maybe. If enough people [ask nicely to Ryan](mailto:ryan.connolly@liferay.com), then we can add to the site.

## Why isn’t there a DXP logo with just “DXP” instead of the whole thing spelled out?

We're waiting for 'DXP' to become more commonly known and used as an acronym more widely across industries. Our writing guidelines permit the use of the acronym after it has been previously spelled out as we want to avoid using too many acronyms that make it difficult for the average person to read.
