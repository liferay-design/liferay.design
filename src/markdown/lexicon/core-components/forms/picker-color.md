This pattern offers two variations, depending on the required usage. Please see the [Variations](#variations) section below for more information.

### Usage

#### Field
![Color picker field](/images/lexicon/Picker-color-field.jpg)

This field has two key areas: The leftmost, or color square, opens the 
predefined palette panel; The rightmost, or field, lets the user input a color's 
hexadecimal value.

#### Predefined Palette Panel

The predefined palette panel provides a set of predefined colors, as well as lets users create new colors to access in the "Custom color panel."

The available colors can be modified via API. Lexicon provides the default color palette shown in the previous image.

The color palette can contain as many colors as you require, but we recommend that you provide at least seven colors.
