### How did you get into design?

The year was 2004 when I found I could read all my favorite manga on the internet. So, I started translating and cleaning up the scans of my favorite manga at the time. But, it really all started when I first saw an anime called YuYu Hakusho on TV. So I got interested in drawing my favorite characters and reading a little bit about anatomy (I was never good at it). In 2005 I founded a website called Projeto Naruto and today it is still the most relevant website about Naruto in Brazil. Since then I've been interested in Photoshop and taught myself how to use the other tools. I've always loved art in general and I've been involved with it since I understand myself as a human being, so ending up in design was never unexpected.


### Why are you at Liferay?

Always wanted to work in a place that I can make a difference and had the same principle as mine. To serve, is something that inspires me and knowing that the company I work for follows the same principles is something that delights me.


### Favorite tool?

Spotify, no doubt about it. But if you’re talking about design, I mean, nothing beats a pencil and a sheet of paper.


### Best lifehack?

Curiosity.


### Where do you find #inspiration?

Watching and searching for random things. I always get carried by the most random things ever.


### One thing you are getting better at?

Tell stories.


### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

Probably something related to design or music. Like an manga editor or music critic.


### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

Van Gogh or Monet. Or One Piece. Most likely.


### Favorite place to visit?

Paris. For sure the beautiful place I’ve ever been. And home. It’s is always nice having a place to go back to.


### Favorite hotkey?

⌘Z Comforts me being able to reverse things when I'm not sure I want to change them. I wish life had that possibility.


### Advice for ambitious designers?

Never give up on trying new things.

And go tour your city. You will probably see different things that you will see on the Internet.


### Favorite superhero

Luffy, Zoro, Jinbe, Law, Oden, Ace and all of the nakamas from One Piece. I really like the Japanese culture.


### Last book you read?

When Giants Walked the Earth by Mick Wall


### Most effective productivity booster?

A pair of Headphones and good music playing in background.


### Favorite Quote?

“Utopia is on the horizon. I move two steps closer; it moves two steps further away. I walk another ten steps and the horizon runs ten steps further away. As much as I may walk, I'll never reach it. So what's the point of utopia? The point is this: to keep walking.” ― Eduardo Galeano


### What keeps you up at night?

The Future.
