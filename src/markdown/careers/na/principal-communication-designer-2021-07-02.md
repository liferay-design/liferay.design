## _Based in Los Angeles, but open to remote candidates in North American time zones._

Are you an experienced designer looking to take the next step in your career, leading a global creative team to new heights?

Communication Design at Liferay partners primarily with Liferay’s Marketing, Sales, and People teams to achieve business results through design.

You’ll be leading visuals at the corporate level and collaborating with design leaders in other functions:

-   Product Design — infusing brand into our user experience
-   Design Research — empowering designers with data
-   Design Operations — producing quality at scale
-   Solutions Design — ensuring brand relevance in industry verticals like manufacturing and insurance

You are a highly collaborative leader who can drive consensus without falling into the dreaded “design by committee” trap.

## What will my first year look like?

One of your first initiatives will be articulating foundational aspects of our brand. Every department sees our brand promise in a different way. We need to figure out what’s at the core, and get alignment so we can all more effectively contribute to building brand value.

Another early project will be working with our talented web designer to lead an update to liferay.com, and other major marketing materials, to reflect strategic shifts in focus and positioning.

Additionally, you will:

1. Work with marketing leadership to provide creative direction that supports their business strategy on new campaigns.
2. Collaborate with other design functions to make our design system / brand guidelines / style guides more cohesive.
3. Contribute to developing a framework for measuring and plan for improving the Liferay brand.
4. Expand and improve existing brand guidelines and resources, proactively communicating to drive self-service.

## What do I need to succeed?

1. **Communication**: if we’ve learned anything from being fully remote for the last 9+ months, proactive, effective communication skills are a must.
2. **Branding**: track record of building and measuring effective brands is a must.
3. **Creative direction**: you have a strong portfolio and help others raise the bar.

## What will help me stand out?

1. **People management**: developing a team’s skills and careers.
2. **Business acumen**: case studies where you achieved business objectives with quality visual design.
3. **Agency experience**: working across cultures and industries, listening and guiding people to a well-designed solution.

## What do I need to apply?

1. Portfolio link
2. In your cover letter (nothing formal), include a brief note with feedback on our brand

## Cover letter? Do you really read them?

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
