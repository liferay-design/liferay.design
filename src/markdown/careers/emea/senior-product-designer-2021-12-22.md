_Establishing a strong design practice across products throughout the globe is a high priority for our business. We’re looking for a Senior Product Designer that can serve our customers and partners while simultaneously working with our existing team based in Spain to continue cultivating a strong design culture there and beyond. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams in North America, Latam, Europe, and Asia that are excited to build with you._


## About This Position

You’ll be working with one of our product teams working on our cloud platform ([DXPC](https://www.liferay.com/en/products/dxp-cloud)), interfacing directly with Product Managers, Engineering leaders, and customers along the complete software development lifecycle.

### Your first 90 days will be:

* Get to know the people, processes, and systems
* Onboard into different product initiatives in various stages
* Add value with your perspective and experience in alignment with our design organization

### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

* **Design leadership experience:** Contribute as an expert with deep knowledge in one or more product design initiatives — and have experience collaborating with senior managers and practitioners.
* **Communication skills:** Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!
* **Proficiency with modern design tools and systems:** Our design system is in Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly, so a track record of tool and system competency is required.


### Language Requirement:

* English: Conversational
* Spanish: Fluent

## What do I need to apply?

1. Portfolio link
2. In your cover letter (nothing formal), include a brief note with feedback on our brand

### Cover letter? Do you really read them?

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
