        Positioning Liferay as a source of solutions, not products, the tagline highlights the unlimited ways in which Liferay’s singular platform can be used to help enterprises do business better. Our team created and developed the concept using origami to convey “many out of one”. 

        After the lockdown, we had to roll out 100% digital campaigns — solution-specific ads for campaigns focused on e-commerce, digital workspace, and self-service portals. Who knows how OPES will evolve in 2021! Stay tuned.

                  We’ll continue to focus on qualitative research, conducting tests with potential users, while expanding our research methodologies to better adapt to the needs of the teams.

                  Additionally, we are creating a repository to make insights and recommendations accessible, making it easier for the work to be useful for more projects.

    message:
        part1: |
            While 2020 has been a year of challenges and adaptations, we are reminded that difficult times are often opportunities for growth. The strength of this team is not in its collective design skillset, but rather in the enduring human bonds we have cultivated and nurtured over the years.

            We’ve been able to rely on one another through our personal and professional journeys — now that we find ourselves in a global pandemic, we once again lean on each other. Our department’s ability to hold each other up throughout this year has made us stronger as people, as designers, and as a team.
        part2:
            title: What’s next?
            body: |
                If this year has shown us anything, it’s that we never really know what’s to come.

                Our product portfolio is becoming more cohesive, we're designing with more and more data, and — most importantly — our designers are growing and helping each other reach their full potential. It’s been a beautiful thing to see. As Liferay grows and adapts, I know we will continue to grow with it.
