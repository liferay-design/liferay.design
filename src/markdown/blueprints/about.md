### Why Blueprints?

<SiteName section="blueprints" dark />

The goal for this site is to increase the value of the Liferay brand. To do that, we need to accomplish three things:

1.  Improve execution
1.  Increase consistency
1.  Build awareness

For more on improvements to execution, read our [brand update (WIP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A-vJ1gQOwn-T-ozTpHHVCz9f_CzcmjRJNnajCrOlLkU/edit?usp=sharing). Weâ€™re providing a centralized repository of knowledge and a shared library of assets to make things more accessible to everyone to increase consistency. As we execute on those two points, we empower everyone to more effectively build awareness.

### Our Approach

Every great brand is built on a strong foundation &mdash; principles, values, an inspiring mission, etc. Here at Liferay we have all of those in spades &mdash; an aspirational mission, concrete values, and developing principles.

Design has grown organically here, siloed by region and function &mdash; up [until fairly recently](https://medium.com/liferay-uxd/liferay-design-week-2018-is-over-feb08e290a5f) we had never all been in the same place, and many of us had never met in person or otherwise! We conducted a Design Principles Workshop, where we all collaborated on drafting principles and shared them with each other. This was a great start, and really amazing to see the amount of common principles that we felt were part of our experience here at Liferay.

The challenge was to take all of the different artifacts, guidelines, and philosophies that we had accrued over time and space and document and work at refining them along the way.

As you can imagine, this is a long process &mdash; and it's still very much in the works, see our [Principles page](/docs/resources/principles) for the current status, and please contribute comments, thoughts, and ideas in our Brand Sprint Results slides.
