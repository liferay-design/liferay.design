## Standups

We recommend a weekly standup, ideally it would be at the beginning of the week. This could be with your local design team, cross-functional team, or both.

### How-to

1. Schedule a 15-minute time-slot on Monday mornings
1. Find a physical place to gather together, stretch, and briefly share:
    1. What you worked on last week
    1. What you're working on this week
    1. Any issues that you could use help with
1. Do a team cheer _(optional)_

## Figma Weeklys

1. Slackbot sends a reminder in your team channel on Wednesday and Friday afternoons
1. Designers add up to 3 frames
    1. Frames can link out to other Figma files, presentations, websites, etc
