### Image with different ratios

Images can vary in size. So no visual information is lost in the card, Lexicon maintains the original images aspect ratio within the image area's container.

Aspect ratio might be used when the content to represent in the card is a document. The image can expand to fill the area.

## User card

User cards represent users. The user is represented by its profile image or a default user icon.

## Folder card

Folder cards display horizontal representations of information. They have the same amount of elements as the other cards previously explained on this page.
