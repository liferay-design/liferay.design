## Autocomplete text field

An autocomplete text field is an input that offers the user text suggestions while they type.

## Search field

A search field is pretty similar to an autocomplete text field, but the field states are defined to reflect search results.

### Usage

A search field can have auto completion to display a list of options below the field.

-   The list below must be as wide as the search field.
-   The list must update its content as the user types.
-   Characters in each entry must be semibold and marked in regular as the user types.

## Numeric field

Use numeric fields when you require the user to enter an integer or float value. Numeric fields provide the added bonus of letting the user increase and decrease the value via the arrow keys and internal field buttons.

## Password field

A password field input is used when the user needs to enter a password.
