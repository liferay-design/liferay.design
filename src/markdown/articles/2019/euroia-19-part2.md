Probably you have already read our [first EuroIA 19 post](../euroia-19-part1). In this second post, we want to highlight the talks that impacted us the most and bring some conclusions over all our experience at this conference.


## The Talks

Along these three conference days, there were two tracks of talks. Our highlight in some of them are:

## The unintended consequences of our design choices

[Aly Blenkin](http://2019.euroia.org/person/aly-blenkin/) 

Technology is neutral? No, because it's human.

It‚Äôs important to understand the implications of our design decisions, and for that:

1. Understand the scale of the problem (rules, regulations, actors, motivations...)
2. Map it and get feedback.
3. Reflect and act. Identify gaps and design for a positive impact 

And reduce the negative impact:

1. Prompt speculations designing for the future
2. Create speeds bumps and use design principles
3. Identify your ethical principles.

### Citizen Centric Information Architecture: Creating a truly Citizen-Centric Digital Government

[Alysson Franklin](http://2019.euroia.org/person/alysson-franklin/)

Use case of redesign for Ohio government. 

Problems to face: who owns the data and sources and information overload, which ended in the lack of trust of the employees, because it is difficult to manage the portal and also the citizens.

6 challenges:

1. De-bureaucratize the authoring layer
2. Turn content tagging an easy task
3. Unify UX and interaction patterns
4. Catalog all info and remove duplicity
5. Rock-solid, yet scalable data model
6. Design for all cultures and societies in Ohio

How did they do it? Using ‚ÄúA pattern language‚Äù. By identifying global patterns, selecting the main ones, providing a structure and taxonomy and allowing the users to create their own taxonomy too (folksonomie)

As a curious thing, This solution was made using Liferay ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### It‚Äôs Not Simple, Stupid! Dealing with Complex Systems and Wicked Problems

[Hertje Brodersen](http://2019.euroia.org/person/hertje-brodersen/)
 
We learned how to identify wicked problems and how to deal with them as well as complex systems:

1. Context. Recognising complexity. ‚ÄúDisasters occur when a complex issue is managed as a complicated or simple one‚Äù
Determine the type of problem (Simple = Bake a cake, Complicated = Build a Rocket, Complex = Raise a child), acknowledge wicked problems, make time to deal with complexity, don‚Äôt use formulaic solutions, act, take responsibility.
2. Planning. Ask tough questions, be realistic and pragmatic, practice critical thinking.
3. Mindset. Designing for complexity. ‚ÄúIt is your job to make others (and yourself) uncomfortable.‚Äù Solve for problems, not tools, learn to live with uncertainty, don‚Äôt get too comfortable.

### Let‚Äôs Destroy Silicon Valley

[Mike Monteiro](http://2019.euroia.org/person/mike-monteiro/)

I have to say that Mike is a very good speaker. He talked with passion and energy because we even heard the cracks of the lectern. However, we felt at some moments out of context like if we were in a political speech. He talked about ethics and morals with cases from Silicon Valley. But, in Europe or Spain with our laws most of those cases would never have existed.

### A hard look in the mirror: language, structure, and privilege in IA

[Lara Portmann](http://2019.euroia.org/person/lara-portmann/)

Very interesting approach on how language can influence people. ‚ÄúThe words we use have consequences. Language shapes reality‚Äù.

And about the privileges. It is important to be aware and recognize, assess and change to include all the people in our designs.

- Who is (not) included?
- What can they (not) do?
- How are other people/actions excluded?
- Why are they excluded? (gender, race, social class, age, disability, sexual orientation ethnicity...)
- What should I change?
- What can I change NOW? 

### A taxonomy of the orcanization ‚Äì game design for information architecture

[Andrea Resmini](http://2019.euroia.org/person/andrea-resmini/)

This talk was an introduction for the workshop he was giving the next day. Andrea compared both digital/physical games, and applications to complex systems showing that they have some common points in the narrative and experiences.

He used digital games such as Prince of Persia and Shadow of Mordor, but also physical games such as Chess and Tic Tac Toe.

 
### Lessons from a Jazz Musician: Improvisation in Research

[Rachel Price](http://2019.euroia.org/person/rachel-price/)

What Rachel did was actually very impressive. 
For the first half of the talk she explained the role of the research facilitator as any other talk out there. In the second half she talked about Jazz and improvisation methods, then she divided the entire public into 3 big groups and got them to clap their hands separately.

![graphic of the future](/images/posts/euroia-19/euroia19-embellistments.png)

It was really fun to be part of this, it was also really interesting to see how she transformed from a speaker to a facilitator that was directing and improvising with the public.

## Conclusion

### Pros

- It was a great event where we had the opportunity to learn techniques and wider points of view  that we can apply to our daily work.
- The workshops were highly valuable.
- We interacted and connected with a lot of designers. We‚Äôve even met a Liferay partner and ended up talking about their projects, our features and how they use our products.
- Ethics were a huge part of this event and it‚Äôs always great to have a refresh of what can go wrong with your work and the impact it can have in others lives.

### Cons

- Ethics was present in several talks and, although we consider it very important, it was too much for us.

Thansk for celebrating this great event. We hope to come back in future editions. ü§ó
