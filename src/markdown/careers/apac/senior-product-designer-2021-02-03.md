A high priority for our business is establishing a design practice in the APAC region. We’re looking for a senior designer with experience as a first-hire that can serve our customers and partners while simultaneously working to establish a strong design culture here. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams in Europe, Latin America, and North America that are excited to build with you.

## About This Position

Primarily, you’ll be working with sales and consulting teams, interfacing directly with prospects and customers along the complete software development lifecycle. Secondly, you’ll establish design in APAC.

Your first 90 days will be:

-   Get to know the people, processes, and systems
-   Onboard into multiple projects in various stages
-   Add value with your perspective and experience leading projects in alignment with our design organization

### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

1. **Design leadership experience**

    Contribute as an expert with deep knowledge in one or more product design verticals — and have experience leading people.

1. **Communication skills**

    Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!

1. **Proficiency with modern design tools and systems**

    Our design system is in Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly, so a track record of tool and system competency is required.

### Language Requirement:

- English: Business Level
- Japanese: Business Level

## What does the application process look like?

1. You send a great portfolio and note, along with your application.
1. Our recruiting manager reviews it, and passes it along to our design hiring managers.
1. The hiring managers will review your portfolio and application and our recruiter will schedule a short phone call with you to confirm details about your application.
1. The recruiting manager will then schedule an interview with your future manager.
1. Congratulations! You’ve made it to the final round — you’ll have a group call with some of the other designers.
1. We send you an offer letter within 1-2 weeks, depending on internal scheduling and our HR workflow.
