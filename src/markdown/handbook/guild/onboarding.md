This document will introduce you to Liferay as an employee and more specifically to Liferay UX Team. The goal is to get familiar with the time and not in one day with all this information.

Liferay is a delocated and multicultural company with offices all around the world still growing and having presence in many countries. One of the main motivations of the company is reflected in the following sentence:

> “To see the people reach their full potential to serve other.”

One of the first steps you should do as an employee is going to our site and log in with your user account.

## Loop

Loop is a Liferay tool for employees that serves as internal communication network. Every employee is in Loop and we are distributed by teams, locations, etc. There are many different groups.

Important groups for you where you are included by default:

-   Engineering as designers are under this group
-   Local office group

You can join as many groups as you want. It is better if you go to Loop and take a tour to discover it.

## Employee Volunteer Program (EVP)

One of the most important actions that Liferay takes in the world is EVP. Liferay invests lot of money and resources in helping others for a better world. Please use your account to read more in the EVP Site to see how employees help the world.

## Current Projects

Liferay has a main product that is DXP where the traditional portal is placed, called DE. But Liferay works in many other projects, some of them for internal use, some others to contribute to the open source community and some other are part of DXP. Some of them are:

-   Loop: previously introduced, is Liferay's enterprise social network. It's designed to help Liferay more effectively organize, communicate, and engage with employees.

-   WeDeploy: helps you build and scale small sites to complex applications.

-   Lexicon: is the experience design language created by Liferay and used in all DXP products.

-   Dossiera: is a Liferay's Internal Business Intelligence Platform. The project is in the early stages of development but will eventually link data from all of Liferay's critical business applications.

## 2017 Challenges

## Multifunctional teams

In Liferay we work in multifunctional teams as we consider it is the most successful way of organizing people for success for our products. You can read more in [this guide](https://docs.google.com/a/liferay.com/document/d/1G9-O5aih_wvNjKyxnWLb4LXAjt-jzuPm6gaEiE453u8/edit?usp=sharing).

Multifunctional teams are usually shaped by:

-   Product manager
-   Project manager
-   UX Designer
-   Front-end engineer
-   Back-end engineer(s)
-   Quality Assurance engineer

Good examples of multifunctional teams for a UX Designer can be WEM (Web Experience Management), Collaboration or Forms. A UX Designer participates in these teams researching, bringing new ideas, doing benchmark, designing, testing, among other tasks.

## Guild

#### UX Design Guild

Liferay is divided in different guilds. As a designer you are part of the UX Design guild. The team of UX / Product designers is divided in 3 main groups: Brazil, Europe and US. The main task of the guild is bridge the communications between the different locations and to align efforts for a stronger team.
