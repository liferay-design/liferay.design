### How did you get into design?

Computers have always appealed to me, so getting interested in design was natural. I don't remember when I started working as a designer, but when I realized I was discussing typography.

### Favorite tool?

Pencil, paper and eraser. Pencil and paper allow me to create in any situation, they are democratic tools and do not need instruction for use. The eraser allows me to reconstruct, reorganize and discuss the design as easily as it was created.

### Best lifehack?

Everyone should try a slice of cold pizza with a hot cup of coffee. A mix of flavors and temperatures.

### Where do you find #inspiration?

Currently Dribbble has been a great source of inspiration. But I love looking for references in design history books, seeing the work of the designers who have made history, always inspires me.

### One thing you are getting better at?

I'm getting better at knowing how to listen to people, I mean, knowing how to select and learn from what a person was concerned with telling him.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

Probably an architect.

### Last book you read?

The Laws of Simplicity by John Maeda

### Most effective productivity booster?

A good playlist.

### What keeps you up at night?

A good book.
