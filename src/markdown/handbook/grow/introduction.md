_The priority in the 2018 Liferay employee survey was a career development path. This is comprised of three major elements; first, relevant and accurate job descriptions. Second, a structure that maps the variety of roles and levels within each department. And third, an evaluation framework for determining where you are, and what is required to traverse the structure._

## Job Descriptions

Design is like a cat — a very enigmatic animal — designers come in all shapes, sizes, and skills. A problem we’ve had for a long time at Liferay is designers doing things that they probably shouldn’t be doing, but because designers are generally “can-do” people, we, of course, say “yes” when we should say “no, but this person can do it better than me”. We still have this. Part of why this happens is a product of Liferay’s culture of organic, unintentional growth. Part of this is geographic and departmental silos.

To begin solving these things, we looked internally to see what sorts of things designers were being asked to do — how effectively they were doing those things, and what sort of work provided the most value to Liferay.

We researched externally, looking at the market — to see what other companies were doing, how other design organizations were and weren’t structured, what positions were established and what new ones were popping up.

Looking internally, there are plenty of examples of different designers being asked to do things they are not trained in or specialize in. Of course, they have “designer” somewhere in their title, but if you hire an interior designer to do the job of an interaction designer, you will most likely be disappointed.

To help resolve some of this confusion, we’ve updated our job descriptions, titles, and team names to be simpler and clearer.

### Job Titles

As [Jared Spool said](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1106290814399975424) — “job titles hurt more than they help” — titles are important, but too many unnecessary distinctions create confusion and too many levels can cause people to focus on their status rather than their output.

To that end, we’ve designated a title for each level that is consistent across the teams. For example, we have Senior Product Designers, Senior Research Designers, and Senior Communication Designers. More on this later.

## Structure

### Design

While we recognize that there are differences in each team’s skills, there are also similarities in what makes a “designer” of any profession, a designer. As a department, we want to steward and attract designers that add to Liferay’s culture. To that end, we’ve identified [transversal skills](/handbook/grow/transversal-skills) that are relevant across design professions and mapped them to Liferay’s core values.

### Teams

The Design Department is comprised of three teams; Communication, Product, and Research. Each of those teams determines the skills required to be a designer on that team. These skills should be relevant to the market and also reflect the ways in which we’re adding value to the company.

The teams are loosely correlated to the three categories of design, [as articulated by John Maeda](https://designintech.report/2016/03/13/design-in-tech-report-2016/) (formerly of MIT and RISD, currently at Automattic), Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design.

#### Design Teams

**Communication Design** | Classical Design

This team is comprised of graphic designers and primarily works with worldwide Marketing and Sales to create assets for customer-facing efforts.

**Design Research** | Design Thinking

This is the newest arm of the Design Department, and is tasked with helping us improve the way we’re doing things so we can understand and better serve our customers.

**Product Design** | Computational Design

The Product Design team works with product management and engineering, and is concerned with the optimization of business value and user experience.

### Levels

Our career path starts with people beginning their design career and is designed to help grow them to seasoned industry leaders. Each skill is divided up into 5 levels, each progressively harder to achieve than the last. The scale is meant to be exponential, and it's expected that people spend an increasing amount of time at each level as they advance.

## Evaluation Framework

The framework, influenced by the work [Medium’s Engineering team shared](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework), assigns an increasing point value to each level.

We’ve noted attributes and actions that approximately describe each level, but these are only to **help provide some guidelines**. We can’t list everything, but these examples should be enough to give a starting point for evaluations and ideas for areas of growth.

The spirit behind these examples is that these things are done **consistently, continuously, and excellently**. They are bullet points — not checklists. It’s human nature to want to accomplish tasks and advance, but we must be careful to avoid doing things simply to receive points. These attributes and actions should flow from your passion, skill, and growth as a designer — not as someone looking to check things off a list.

These things must be tracked and measured over significant periods of time — of course there are always exceptions to every rule, but this is how we should generally approach evaluations.

It’s also important to keep in mind that although there are points, this is not a game or a competition. _Everyone has different skills, ambitions, and pace_. And these things will vary, not only from person to person, but from year to year as individuals advance through stages in life.

### How to Evaluate People

We’re providing [a tool](https://path.liferay.design/) that will help managers evaluate their designers and help them visualize the overall composition of their teams. It will also help designers self-evaluate and provide direction for any areas that they want to focus on.

A key attribute of the evaluation process is that it is an **open dialog**. As you go through each of the skill levels have a candid conversation with your teammate. The rubric is not perfect and as you come across anything from typos to philosophical differences, please share corrections, thoughts, and ideas in comments on [the source material](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R8NyMN4h3IUAgWT6kYJxQkW5O9f9QOGY&authuser=41785571@liferay.com&usp=drive_fs).

The major steps in the evaluation process are:

1. **Record** — the point of evaluations is to measure and track progress. For each skill, make notes of evidence that supports the designer’s level during the given time period.
2. **Prioritize** — rank the skills from 1-5 so the designer can have a way to prioritize their energy over the specified period of time. This prioritization should balance the goals and needs of the company, team, and designer.
3. **Act** — together, create concrete tasks and goals for each of the skill areas that the designer will be focusing on. As a manager you may have more insights into company and team needs, but synthesizing those with the designers skills, desires, and potential are critical for the success of all.

We send a survey to the various project or product leads twice a year that asks questions related to [transversal skills](/handbook/grow/transversal-skills). This helps each manager understand how effectively the designer is serving their team.
