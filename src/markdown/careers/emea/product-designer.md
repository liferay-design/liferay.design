_We’re looking for a product designer to work in our core products creating engaging experiences in business critical functions. As a product designer you will work inside a multidisciplinary product team with its own business goals. You will use Lexicon to build interfaces and contribute to it with the business needs of your team to make it stronger. You will also collaborate with other product teams all around the world, therefore good communication skills are essential to this position._

This position will design within the experience management product suite and will have the opportunity to participate in the complete software development cycle. This product area includes content management capabilities such as localization, SEO management, blog management and document library features.

Meet some designers on the team: [Carolina](https://liferay.design/team/rodriguez-carolina), [Susana](https://liferay.design/team/vazquez-susana) and [María](https://liferay.design/team/arce-maria).

1. **Visual and interaction design proficiency:** Our products continuously evolve with better visual and interaction design decisions. We are looking for someone able to propose improvements that positively impact our products.

2. **Communication skills:** Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!

3. **Proficiency with modern design tools and systems:** Our design system is in Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly, so a track record of tool and system competency is required.

### Language Requirement:

* English: Conversational

## What do I need to apply?

1. Portfolio link
2. In your cover letter (nothing formal), include a brief note with feedback on our brand

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
