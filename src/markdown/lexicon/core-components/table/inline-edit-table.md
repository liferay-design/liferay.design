### Usage

* Use an inline edit table when you need to list information that may require quick editing. This pattern is used for cases such as commerce where editing is often required.
* The "Edit" button is always visible since its the main feature of the inline edit table.
* Each row has two different modes:
	* View mode
	* Edit mode
* This table doesn't have a responsive version for mobile devices.

### Row modes

#### View mode
* It is the default status of the row in which the table data is not editable.
* To enter edit mode, click the Edit button.
* More actions are available under the actions button. If an element has an edit screen, name it "Advanced edit."

#### Edit mode
* In this mode, if an entry is editable, it is transformed into one of the following input fields when it's clicked: text field, numeric field, select, etc.
* This mode has two different actions:
	* Save: saves the changes and enters view mode.
	* Cancel: discards the changes and enters view mode.
