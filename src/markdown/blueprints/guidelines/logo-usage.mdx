As recommended by the Liferay Legal Department, please use logos with the registered trademark wherever possible. Contact Legal with any specific questions you may have in regards to your use case.

## Usage Guidelines for Liferay Logos

1. Use only the given color combinations for logos. Do not change all or part of the logo color.

<DoDont

	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/color-dont.png"
/>

1. Maintain the integrity of the logo lockup — do not use parts of the logo as graphical elements.

<DoDont
	good="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/lockup-do.png"
	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/lockup-dont.png"
/>

1. Use only the approved, outlined logo files — do not recreate or modify the logo.

<DoDont
	good="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/modify-do.png"
	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/modify-dont.png"
/>

1. Maintain the legibility of the logo — avoid placing on busy backgrounds or textures, if absolutely necessary use a combination of overlays or shadows with the single color version of the logo.

<DoDont

	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/legible-dont.png"
/>

1. Maintain an appropriate level of clear space around the logo — in this case, more is less.

<DoDont
	good="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/space-do.png"
	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/space-dont.png"
/>

1. Take care when resizing the logo, pressing the shift-key will help you keep the proper aspect ratio — don’t icon or stretch the logo.

<DoDont

	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/resize-dont.png"
/>

1. If you need a logo for your site or project, the best thing to do is ask! The second best thing is to use the icon + your site or project name, don’t try to make a new logo!

<DoDont
	good="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/logo-do.png"
	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/logo-dont.png"
/>

1. Maintain the integrity of the icon — don’t break it out of the container or display parts of it.

    	bad="/images/blueprints/logo-usage/icon-dont.png"

### I Solemnly Swear I Am up to No Good

## Liferay Partner Logos

The Liferay corporate logo is the most visible and recognizable expression of the Liferay brand. We understand and appreciate that our partners may want to show affiliation with Liferay. However, use of the corporate logo for any reason without express written permission from Liferay is strictly prohibited.

In order to show your affiliation with Liferay, you can use the Liferay Partner Program logo that reflects your program level. You’ll find information about these logos and their use in the Partner Brand Guidelines brochure, which you can find on the [Partner Portal](https://partner.liferay.com).
