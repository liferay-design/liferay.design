## Two Tracks

Our career path starts with people beginning their design career and is designed to help grow them to seasoned industry leaders.

We recognize that not everyone wants to manage people — and that's great — we need to ensure there’s room for all to grow. We have designed a dual-track path, one for [people management](/handbook/grow/career-paths/management) and one for [individual contribution](/handbook/grow/career-paths/individual-contributor).

## Evaluations

We have found that its helpful, especially for individual contributors, to be able to see where they are &mdash; and what they need to do to get to the next level.

We've created a framework for this, and an accompanying tool that is designed to foster a conversation between a designer and their manager.
