### Can you share a fun fact about you?

I love crafting and gardening. Once I had a carnivorous plant, now I have an orchard in the city.

### How did you get into design?

I like to find solutions to problems, I want to give a positive and a better world to my kids. I used to be a lawyer, and my soul missed finding creative visual solutions; so I decided to go into the design and tech world. I became a UX/UI certified by UC Berkeley, and now here I am Product Designer at Liferay.

### Why are you at Liferay?

Liferay seems like an awesome team, who cares for people and the design process, and are there to inspire, support and encourage to grow. All the hard work they are doing to make you feel comfortable looks amazing and seems like they have a good sense of humor too.

### Favorite tool?

Figma, pencil and paper.

### Best lifehack?

Prepare something yummy and simple, like lemonade, potato with cheese, or strawberries with cream, that makes you feel ready for any challenge later.

### Where do you find #inspiration?

Mother Nature, it’s amazing and powerful. I think about rainbows and storms, they have every detail so well done, that awaken your senses. It’s simple and complex at the same time, so beautiful

### One thing you are getting better at?

Emotional intelligence and expressing my feelings outside my trusted circle.

### One misconception about design you try to clear up?

Design is not only pretty, it's a way to communicate and to create an impact in our lives.

### If you weren’t designing, what would you be doing?

Anything that involves a creative problem solving mind, the first thing that came to my mind is carpenter.

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

My desktop has markers and an articulated wooden doll that I use to express myself.

### Favorite place to visit?

Hard to pick one. In general, any place which is a weather killer, surrounded by trees or mountains, or waves. I enjoyed a beautiful beach in my country named Punta Sal, also I liked Cusco, Magic Machu Picchu.

In the Peruvian jungle is cloudy place, calls Oxapampa, and of course Huancayo where go to visit my family.

### Favorite superhero?

Wonder Woman and Professor Charles Xavier.

### Favorite hotkey?

`Ctrl/Cmd + Z` and `Ctrl/Cmd Y` — undo and redo.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Stay curious, don’t hesitate to ask questions.

### Last book you read?

_Gone with the Wind_ by Margaret Mitchell. In this pandemic time, this book has become my best friend, because it is about overcoming difficulties in unprecedentedly changing times. The American Civil War, death of the people close to you, financial crisis, growing up, adaptation, decision making.

### Most effective productivity booster?

Music, coffee, singing — I'm a terrible singer, but it encourages me to face my fears

### Best interview question?

If you have to design for blind users, how would you design?

### [What keeps you up at night?](http://whatkeepsyouupatnight.io)

Sometimes my dog barks, I don't know why — and when it's celebration time :)
