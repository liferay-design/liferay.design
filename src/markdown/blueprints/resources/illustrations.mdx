Custom illustrations elevate and support the content &mdash; they are not meant to replace good copywriting nor are they to capture a complete idea down to the very last detail. They are used to create a mood for a specific piece of content. To that end, we need to take care to preserve the impact that they have by not over-using illustrations for pieces they were not specifically designed for.
