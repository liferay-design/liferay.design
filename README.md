# Liferay.Design

## About

The online presence of Liferay's Design Teams!

Designed in [Figma](https://figma.com), built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), powered by [WeDeploy](https://wedeploy.com).

## 👾 Getting started

### If you don't have a dev environment

Skip down to [Starting Phresh](#starting-phresh) for a step-by-step guide.

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**

    - open Terminal and type:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    - hit Enter, then do the same for the command below

1. **Start up the dev server**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

1. Open up your [favorite browser](https://opera.com), type `localhost:7777` into the nav bar, and watch your work magically appear!

1. **Pushing work to the upstream dev branch will automagically build the site**

1. Once build is complete visit [the dev site to see it](https://site-liferaydotdesign-dev.wedeploy.io).

    If you're in the WeDeploy project, you can view build status on the [logs page](https://console.wedeploy.com/projects/liferaydotdesign-dev/services/liferaydesign/logs).

## ⛩ Structure

### 🌳 Branches

#### Master

Currently live on [liferay.design](https://liferay.design), it's compiled from the dev branch by Travis CI and then WeDeployed. Don't work on Master, as your pull request won't get accepted 😬.

#### Dev

Work and submit pull requests from the `dev` branch.

#### vN

We save "versions" of the site as branches &mdash; v1 (for example) was the first ever version of the site.

TODO: deploy old versions on subdomains.

---

### 📂 Folders

#### Deploy

This contains the scripts that make the site magically appear when new work gets pulled into the repo &mdash; real developers made this for us, and we generally don't touch it.

#### src

The src folder is where all the code is that gets compiled into a `public` folder which gets rendered onto the interwebs at [our domain](https://liferay.design). We roughly follow [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) principles.

##### components

Where all of our react components live &mdash; atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and theme.

##### markdown

This is where 98.3% of the site content lives &mdash; [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) is a lot easier to write than html 🤓.

##### pages

Surprise surprise, this is where the code for the main pages of [liferay.design](https://liferay.design) lives.

##### theme

Stylesheets and other theme-related files.

##### utils

[Auth](https://wedeploy.com/docs/auth/getting-started/) is our only utility &mdash; but it's so great it gets its own folder.

#### static/images

This is where we store all the... you guessed it, images! There's probably a better way to do this, so please help us out.

## 💁 What do all these files do?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── wedeploy.json

1. **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for a tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby node APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

13. **`wedeploy.json`**: [WeDeploy](https://wedeploy.com/) takes care of deploying and hosting our site! It's pretty great. The ~3 lines of code basically:

    1. tell which project we're working on
    2. what kind of thing we're doing (in this case, hosting files)
    3. which files to serve.

    Amazing.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

-   **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

-   **To dive straight into code samples head [to our documentation](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the “Guides”, API reference, and “Advanced Tutorials” sections in the sidebar.

## Starting Phresh

This is written for people who generally try to avoid the terminal &mdash; it can be scary, but Liferay.Design is a lot like Zelda (you don't have to go alone 🥁)!

Any of the [designers here](https://github.com/orgs/liferay-design/people) can help you, or at least point you to someone who can.

Set aside about 45 &mdash; 60 min to get set up.

### Step 1: Create a Github Account _(3 min)_

1. [Set up a personal account](https://github.com/join)
1. Choose the "free" plan
1. Tailor your experience &mdash; if you'd like, this can be helpful

### Step 2: Familiarize yourself with Git and Github _(20 min)_

1. Read [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and complete the tutorial. _(10 min)_
    - If you really, really, really aren't interested in this "technical" stuff, then this tutorial covers everything you'll need to create your bio page.
1. Read [Chris' post on Git Commit Messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) &mdash; this will help you avoid Paul-like commit messages.
1. Read the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) _(10 min)_ for a good overview on the theory behind Git and GitHub.
    - **_NB_** This is important and helpful information to understand at a high level because Liferay uses Git.
1. Check out the [GitHub's resources](https://try.github.io/), and the [team's Trello cards](https://trello.com/b/500Ghgdu/development) on Git.

### Step 3: Let's git it started™ _(20 min)_

1. Congratulate Paul on that amazing section title 👆
1. Visit our [Phresh-N-Clean](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean) guide &mdash; this whole thing is pretty helpful for setting up your computer in a way that it can quickly and easily be reformatted and restored will help your computer stay faster, better, longer. (So you can `work it`.)
1. Complete steps [1](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#1-homebrew-link), [2](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#2-node--npm-link), [4](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#4-homebrew-cask-link), and [6](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#6-git--github-link) of the [Set Up](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#set-up) portion
1. Install a code editor — [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    - `brew cask install sublime-text` or `brew cask isntall visual-studio-code`

### Step 4: The Clone Wars _(2 min)_

1. Pat yourself on the back, you're almost done &mdash; the last thing to do is get a local copy (code on your computer) of the site repository (repo for short).
1. Orient yourself
    1. Open your Terminal and type `ls` and hit Enter &mdash; this command will list the files and folders of the current directory (folder)
    1. Type `open .` and hit Enter &mdash; this will open up Finder to the current directory.
    1. Type `mkdir github` and hit Enter &mdash; now look at your Finder, you should now see a new folder labeled 'github' in your Home directory (`~/`)
    1. Type `cd github` and hit Enter &mdash; you've now navigated to the github folder in your Terminal!
    - \_Note that this is our suggested method for organizing your repos, feel free to organize differently.
1. Now that your Terminal is open to your github folder, it's time to clone the repo! ![location of clone button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/tree/dev/static/images/documentation/clone-repo.png@2x)
1. Copy the url to your clipboard (there's a handy little button 📋)
1. Type `git clone`, paste the repo url and hit Enter &mdash; cloning should take about 10 seconds.
1. Now you need to navigate to the folder &mdash; type `cd life` and hit Tab, it should autocomplete to `liferay.design` &mdash; if it does, hit enter, if not, finish typing it out
1. Take your fingers off the keyboard, and give yourself a hand, you're now ready to [begin development](#quick-start)!
