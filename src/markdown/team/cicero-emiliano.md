### How did you get into design? 🚀

I went to a basic graphic design school where I started using photoshop 7, it was the starting point of my curiosity about design that helped me to became self-taught about it and seek for knowledge.

I’ve got my first job related to design when I was 16, for Eko, an Italian company that builds musical instruments and needed help with its 800 pages catalog.
Fun fact: my first check was a guitar and an amplifier.

### Favorite tool? ✏️

I spend most of my work time using Figma, when I’m not working I’m probably trying to persuade someone to use it.

### Best lifehack? 🍕

Margherita pizza can tell you everything about an Italian restaurant.

### Where do you find #inspiration? 📚

I’m always updating the Dribbble popular page but most of the inspiration comes from printed supports like Magazines or books, I like to learn from the final work directly and magazines still provide the best results for grids and typography. My last buy: "the work of Hipgnosis".

### One thing you are getting better at? 🤓

Lately, I'm getting better at speaking in public and expressing my design knowledge. I feel in the correct path to talk as the design rock stars in the stage.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing? 📸

I’m passionate about photography, music and video games, so probably one of those.

### Advice for ambitious designers? ⏰

Don’t wait for an opportunity to start designing and create your opportunities. You can work on your own projects, provide help to open source projects or even help non-profit organizations.
