### Usage

Control Menu Bar is always fixed to the top of the window when we are on medium/large screens.

This header is used on almost every page in the system. It has 2 differnet modes that are displayed depending on the product area the user is:

- Light mode: active for back-office applications
- Dark mode: active for the site

### Modes & Parts

Both modes are pretty similar and therefore they work similiarly but with a slight change in the position of the global menu access depending on the scope the user is.

#### Dark mode
