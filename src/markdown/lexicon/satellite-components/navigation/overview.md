This section describes the main navigational patterns, although more patterns are available.

![navigation configuration DE](/images/lexicon/Navigation.jpg)

Product navigation in DXP DE is always done through the [product menu](../../sidebar/product-menu). This sidebar acts as side navigation pattern and is always placed on the left side of the screen. It can be displayed or hidden with the product menu icon.

![navigation configuration DE Parts](/images/lexicon/NavigationParts.jpg)

Page navigation can have different compositions but it always follows a same pattern:

1. Header (mandatory): Displays the application name
    1. Product menu button
    2. Page / Application name
    3. Application actions such as Export/Import or Permissions
2. Application sections: Only use sections if the application has more than one section
