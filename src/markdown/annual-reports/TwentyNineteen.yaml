    content:
        While we recognize that there are differences in each team’s skills, there are also similarities in what makes a “designer” of any profession, a designer. As a department, we want to steward and attract designers that add to Liferay’s culture.
        The Design Department is comprised of three teams; Communication, Product, and Research. Each of those teams determines the skills required to be a designer on that team. These skills should be relevant to the market and also reflect the ways in which we’re adding value to the company.

    subtitle:
        This year Design for Life(ray) served Underground Writing, an organization that runs creative workshops that empowers personal transformation in migrant, incarcerated, recovery, and other at-risk communities through literacy.

        Liferay designers spent some time at the end of the year to give Underground Writing a top to down make-over. This included a brand new website, completely revamped tech stack, and service design optimizations.
