## Why Use Photography?

Images quickly convey complex information, feelings, and emotions. When used correctly, they increase the memorability of the other content they're supporting.

## Guidelines

4. **Reinforce the Content**

    - There should be some intentionality behind your choices, however there is power in suggestion and subtlety &mdash; you don't need to have a 1:1 correlation between the title and the photo.

5. **Be Human** (reflect reality)
    - Be authentic and genuine &mdash; don't look staged
    - Put a face to technology
        - People behind it
        - People benefiting from it
        - Intentional, relatable use of emotion
    - There is inherent value in diversity
        - Try to avoid excessively styled photos or stereotypical personas
6. **Be Clear and Harmonious**

    1. The photograph should not have to rely on obvious edits or stock filters to be compelling
    1. The best editing goes unnoticed
7. **Be Legal** &mdash; don't use copyrighted images without the appropriate permissions or licenses in place.
