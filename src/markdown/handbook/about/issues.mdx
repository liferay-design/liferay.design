We use [GitHub's Projects feature](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/projects/8) to manage all things related with the Handbook.

_If you haven't already, please see [our GitHub guide](/handbook/tools/github/introduction)._

## Create an Issue

1. Create a [Handbook issue](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/issues/new?template=handbook_request.md)
1. Share the issue and recruit help
1. Follow along and contribute as necessary until it's done

The issue will move along the board as we are able to prioritize and work on it.

## Recruiting help

There are a few ways to do this — the best way is to start a conversation in the issue itself, this allows for open, asynchronous collaboration.

Do this by `@` tagging someone who you think would be interested or could have more information to share.

If the issue is potentially sensitive, you can start a thread on the corresponding [#t-design-github](slack://user?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CMLT0TBH7) post when you first created the issue.
