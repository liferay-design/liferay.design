This pattern has different variants, for several use purposes. Please read the [Examples](#examples) section below to know more about them.

### Usage

#### Field

![Color picker field](/images/lexicon/Picker-color-field.jpg)

This field has two key areas: The leftmost, or color square, opens the
predefined palette panel; The rightmost, or field, lets the user input a color's
hexadecimal value.

#### Predefined Palette Panel

![Color picker open at predefined panel](/images/lexicon/Picker-color-panel-predefined.jpg)

Predefined palette panel gives access to a set of predefined colors and the possibility of creating new colors to be defined in the “Custom color panel”

The available colors can be modified via API. Lexicon provides the default color palette shown in the previous image.

The color palette can contain as many colors as you require, but we recommend that you provide at least seven colors.
