1.  **Confident** &mdash; _Business done well will improve the world._
1.  **Candid** &mdash; _We make great software that helps people make use of technology to help companies achieve success._
1.  **Humble** &mdash; _Help people reach their full potential to serve others._

### Where Does This Come From?

To start this process, we held a Brand Sprint with Bryan Cheung to get the 30,000-foot view of Liferay, gather and prioritize our values and audiences, and translate subjective concepts about personality into some objective qualities that we can start to render.

In preparation for this, we surveyed a small, but diverse, focus group comprised of a wide variety of departments and regions &mdash; in order to come to the sprint with a good idea of where these people felt that we were.

One of the most important takeaways from the sprint, is that we need to continue to create open and direct lines of communication with our customers. Long-term we want to be an ecosystem partner with them, anticipating and meeting their needs, making technology useful for them.

### That’s Great and All — but What Does That Look Like?

Our values are reflected in all areas of Liferay and the guiding principles by which we make decisions — from hiring, to engineering, to supporting — are all informed by these values. Our personality reflects our values — We are **confident** that business done well can improve the world, **candid** about how our technology enables companies to achieve success, and **humble** in our approach to helping people reach their full potential to serve others.

We have a candid, humble voice in our marketing and sales materials — to support and balance this, our visuals are confident, bold, and vibrant — but not overly so. We are expressive, playful, and aiming for mass appeal while still walking the line between conventional and disruptive, slightly more young and innovative than mature and classic.
