### Left navigation menu

A left navigation menu lets you simplify a form into smaller, more manageable forms. It's best to divide a form by context.
When using a left navigation menu, the title's name must match the menu item's name.

### Wizards

Forms can be used together with wizards (also called Multi step forms). Wizards let you simplify the complexity of a large form by reorganizing it into a **process** of smaller consecutive forms that **you want the user to go through**.

There are 2 types of wizards:
* A Multi Step Form (also called a Wizard form) is used to divide the main tasks of a large form into smaller forms that contain subtasks and report the user's progression through the form. See [Multi Steps Forms](../multiStepForm) for more information.

* A simplified Multi Step form simply displays the user's progression through a form in a much less intrusive manner. Below is an example of a simplified Multi Step form **used in a Modal**. See [simplified multi step form](../multi-step-form-simplified) for more information.
