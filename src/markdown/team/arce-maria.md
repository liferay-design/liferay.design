### How did you get into design?

When I was a child I wanted to be a painter and I guess I've follow that path in some kind of way...

I've always loved designing things, it doesn't matter what. It could be an illustration for a poster, a little piece of furniture or something for the web and user experience world. I think this passion is related to creating new things.

### Best lifehack?

Being happy is often a personal decision

### Where do you find #inspiration?

Everywhere, I really like talking to people and doing different and new plans. Iâ€™m a very curious person and I know we can learn from the most unexpected things and people.

### One thing you are getting better at?

I want to improve my illustration and animation skills.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

Maybe something related to the audiovisual world or programming, I find it very interesting

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

I want things organized so I have my desktop as clear as possible.

### Favorite tool?

I am an absolutely Figma's fan but I also like sketching in a more traditional way, pen and paper are always a good idea.


### Favorite place to visit?

My dream would be traveling all around the world and learning from all of the new places but it would be perfect if my next stop could be Japan or Iceland.

### Favorite superhero

I really like Dr. Strange because of his ability to control time.

### Most effective productivity booster?

I find especially helpful speaking out loud for finding out new ideas, but some good music and coffee are also the key.

### What keeps you up at night?

Nothing, I really love sleeping ^^
