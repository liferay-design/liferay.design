## Why a Handbook?

  1. **Global Department** 30+ Designers
  1. **Global Standards** increase our potential
  1. **Global Operations** reduces cost

As a department, we want to be intentional about implementing and improving our craft so that we can become increasingly effective at what we do.


## How Do We Operate?

  1. **Intentional** effective practices
  1. **Inclusive** open collaboration
  1. **Honest** transparent standards

We strive to be an inclusive organization, our handbook is designed to be a collaborative document. Many people and teams have contributed to the content we’re starting with — and processes we’ve set up enable all to contribute as we iterate and improve.

By opening up the handbook to others outside of our department and Liferay, our goal is to provide an example of the open source ethos that guided Liferay in the early days.

## Contribute

This handbook is as good as we make it — so your contributions are incredibly valuable! 

The things we’re prioritizing over the next few months are intended to make it easier for you to contribute, so your feedback will be much appreciated.

We’ll be managing the handbook using GitHub’s Projects feature for two main reasons:

  1. In context — the site and handbook are built using github’s open source code management tool, using their project management features allows us to easily keep track of issues and progress
  1. Open to all — anyone is able to create an account and contribute

Some people may hear “Github” and think — well, I’m not a coder, so I can’t really contribute — **this could not be further from the truth**.

Creating, managing, and simply participating in issues is a huge help to the department — of course writing guides and developing features is also very much welcome.

And of course, we also have a slack channel — [#des-ops](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CL2KU6A65).
