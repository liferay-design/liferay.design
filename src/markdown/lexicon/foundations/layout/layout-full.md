This layout is used in the [dataset display](../../../core-components/dataset-display) template.

## Responsive behavior

The full box layout is fluid and occupies 100% of the container's width across the different breakpoints.

Note, however, that the lateral space is removed from the layout on displays smaller than 576 px.
