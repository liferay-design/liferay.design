## How Do Liferay’s Core Values Look in the Design Team?

*   **Produce excellence** — we strive to become masters in our craft, doing the right thing even if no one notices.
*   **Lead by serving** — we’re all willing to do the unglamourous work and always looking for opportunities to help others.
*   **Value people** — we listen first and believe that everyone can contribute because there is strength in diversity.
*   **Grow and get better** — we’re always learning, when we find ways to improve our designs we take them, when we make mistakes we admit, apologize, and move forward. We fail a lot, but we aren’t failures because we learn and improve.
*   **Stay nerdy** — we live and breathe design, but we also have passions outside of work — rock climbing, coffee, photography, writing — and pursue them to the n-th degree.

*   Attractive benefits;
