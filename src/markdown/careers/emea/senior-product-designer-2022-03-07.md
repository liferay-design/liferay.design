## About This Position

Providing design services to our customers by applying design best practices in the EMEA region is a high priority for our business. We’re looking for a senior designer with agency experience that can serve our customers and partners while simultaneously growing our design culture and presence in the community. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and North America that are excited to build with you.

You’ll be working with sales and consulting teams, interfacing directly with prospects and customers along the complete software development lifecycle.

Sometimes you’ll work independently, guiding stakeholders along the entire design process from research and strategy to implementation, iterating along the way. Other times you'll work collaboratively with other designers to deliver the entire experience for customer projects.

Recent enterprise solutions this role has delivered for were customer and insurance agent portals, an employee intranet for a healthcare org, and a multi-site e-commerce solution for a major manufacturer.

## Who Are We Looking For?

### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

1. **Experience facilitating design thinking workshops**

    User centered design is not only what we practice, but we are advisors to stakeholders and cross-functional team members on how to approach business and user problems with design thinking.

2. **Communication skills**

    Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — communication is both clearly articulating your design rationale while synthesizing stakeholders' input to achieve alignment and define the path forward.

3. **Leading projects end to end**

    Design Leads on projects need to be [T-shaped designers](https://chiefexecutive.net/ideo-ceo-tim-brown-t-shaped-stars-the-backbone-of-ideoaes-collaborative-culture__trashed/) that can deliver every step of the way from the discovery phase through designing mockups for implementation and development handoff to bring products to life.

### Other Qualifications

-   3+ years experience delivering end to end designs for products and not just sites
    -   Agency experience working with clients to manage expectations is ideal
-   Problem solving skills to translate complex business processes into streamlined user experiences
-   Owned or worked within design systems that you regularly contributed to and helped evolve
-   Experience leading a visual design direction for a new or redesigned product that accounts for accessibility requirements

## What will you be doing?

-   Lead multiple projects - ranging from discovery workshops, design concepts for presales, to fully developed enterprise products
-   Collaborate with other designers as well as cross-functionally as a design consultant to our internal team of project managers and engineers and especially clients who often have no prior knowledge of design & UX.
-   Utilize and contribute robust patterns to our Figma component library
-   Increase our design organization's impact in the company by sharing your perspective and experience leading projects and refining processes

## How Do Liferay’s Core Values Look in the Design Team?

-   **Produce excellence** — we strive to become masters in our craft, doing the right thing even if no one notices.
-   **Lead by serving** — we’re all willing to do the unglamourous work and always looking for opportunities to help others.
-   **Value people** — we listen first and believe that everyone can contribute because there is strength in diversity.
-   **Grow and get better** — we’re always learning, when we find ways to improve our designs we take them, when we make mistakes we admit, apologize, and move forward. We fail a lot, but we aren’t failures because we learn and improve.
-   **Stay nerdy** — we live and breathe design, but we also have passions outside of work — rock climbing, coffee, photography, writing — and pursue them to the n-th degree.

## What Can We Offer You?

A place to make a lasting impact — we strongly believe in using business as a tool for restoration. Think Patagonia’s commitment to the environment, just extended to the whole world. Some initiatives that we’ve recently worked in are fighting human trafficking, helping foster youth, and serving refugees.

-   Salary package commensurate with qualifications and experience.
-   40 hours per year to volunteer at a nonprofit of your choice.
-   2.5 weeks of vacation + 10 holidays.
-   Room to assume responsibility and grow professionally.
-   Be part of a great team and work with designers around the world.
-   Work in a company that has strong executive support for Design.
