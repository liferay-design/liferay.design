### Usage

Header is always fixed to the top of the window.

The Header is used on almost every page in the system. The most common configuration is shown below:

-   Left area: Used for actions such as triggering the side menu and back navigation
-   Center area: Used for the page or application title and help
-   Right area:
    -   Actions: They are identified with an icon when existing, and listed inside an actions menu when an icon is not clear. These actions are application level actions.
    -   User Sticker: It allows displaying different navigation options and actions to which the user has access.
