#### How did you get into design?

I had just finished a master's degree in Illustration from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco and a friend of mine in Chicago thought I'd be a good fit as a designer at the Design Agency where he was employed. The rest is history and I've enjoyed every moment of it.

#### Favorite tool?

My favorite tool is pen and paper. That's the one tool that makes me feel like I am in complete control of everything I do. I also feel like I have more opportunity to be original and unique by creating every bump and every line by myself.

#### Best lifehack?

Everyone knows the answer to this is chips on a sandwich.

#### Where do you find #inspiration?

I love Dribbble and podcasts but the real place I get inspiration is from looking at old sketches or going to museums.

#### One thing you are getting better at?

I'm getting better at helping people move to the next level of their design career. I feel like we are all victim to becoming stagnant and hitting plateaus. But now that I have the experience of what helps me overcome those obstacles I feel I can impart that knowledge to others.

#### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

There's no question that I would be illustrating like a mad man.

#### Advice for ambitious designers?

Never stop practicing. Design is a skill that needs to be practiced and constantly worked on -- good things don't just happen out of nowhere.
