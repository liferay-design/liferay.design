_We’re looking for a product designer with a special focus on creating, maintaining and delivering design systems to work for the Lexicon team who serves designers all around the world. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! David will lead you in the process and we have a global design division with teams all over the world that are excited to build with you._


## About This Position

You’ll be working within the Lexicon team, Liferay’s Design System. Lexicon creates and maintains the design system while supporting and collaborating with designers in product teams by giving design infrastructure support to our products.

Your first 90 days will be:

* Get a strong knowledge of Lexicon and our products
* Add value with your perspective and experience in projects in alignment with our design system

### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

1. **Visual design proficiency:** Design Systems require a strong technical background. There are key decisions to take that must be based on technical knowledge we expect you to have.

2. **Communication skills:** Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!

3. **Proficiency with modern design tools and systems:** Our design system is in Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly, so a track record of tool and system competency is required.
