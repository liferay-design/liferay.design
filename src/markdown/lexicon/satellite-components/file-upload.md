### Simple File Upload

Simple file upload is used to upload a simple file element.

### Multiple File Upload

Inside this categorization we have two different patterns: file uploader and image uploader. Both are pretty similar, but the second one is more visual and adapted to the situation.

Both uploaders share the same **upload area** which has the following attributes:

-   It must always have two different states:

    -   Default

        -   Message: clarifies the permitted file extensions and max size of each file
        -   Secondary button: users may not always want to use the drag and drop feature. The button opens the operating system's file uploader with the option to select multiple files.

    -   Active

        -   It contains an animation that invites users to drop documents on dropover state.

-   Once files have been added to the upload system, there must be clear options to upload more files: An explicit button and a drag and drop option.
-   The scroll must only be vertical if needed.
-   Each file can be deleted individually.
-   Each file can retry the upload individually.

#### File Uploader

-   File uploader accepts any file, including images, pdfs, docs, etc.
-   After dropping files in the area, the upload status of each file is displayed in a list.
-   Files that didn't complete the upload process provide the option to retry the upload.
-   Every file must be removable.

In this example, the file uploader works together with a form to predefine configuration options for the uploaded files:

Files can be in different states:

-   Default state: when the file is already uploaded

    ![file upload list row default state](/images/lexicon/FileUploadListDefault.png)

-   Upload state: during the upload process

-   Error state: when the file upload has failed

#### Image Uploader

-   Image uploader only admits image file types.
-   After dropping images in the area, an image grid appears, letting the user see the upload process.
-   The drag and drop area fills the image grid. This area must have a vertical scroll. The cell next to the last uploaded image must have a "+" to invite the user to upload more files. Clicking in that cell opens the file upload for the specified files.
-   Each image is represented by a square thumbnail.
-   Images that didn't complete the upload process provide the option to retry the upload.
-   Every image must be removable.

Images can be in different states:

-   Upload state: during the upload process. The default state is shown in the image on the left. The hover state is shown in the image on the right.

-   Error state: when the file upload has failed

-   Default and hover image states: when the file is already uploaded

-   The image uploader may require a checked state for certain options:
