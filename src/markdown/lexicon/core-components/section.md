### Types

#### Section

When used in its simplest form, not being collapsible, it provides a way to display information in a hierarchical structure.

#### Section Collapsible

Sections can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide content contained within. To show that users perform this action, it displays an icon that changes based on whether the component is open or closed.
