<p>Cards for navigation and Alerts with action</p>

Today we bring to improvements:

-   **NEW COMPONENT**: Card for navigation that are useful in distributive pages.
-   **UPDATE** Alerts with buttons to differentiate actions from navigation. Navigation is provided by links.
-   **UPDATE**: Typography > Contetn Alignment

<time>February 14th, 2019</time>
<p>New resources</p>

Big news for the open source community:

1. Emiliano shares his experience "Building a component library with Figma".
2. We shared our Figma library so you can now see we implemented it and play around with it. Please provide us with feedback directly on the library or through git.

You can find both at [resources](../../resources).

<p>Stickers update</p>

Stickers have been updated due to accessibility and internacionalization reasons. Text inside sticker was causing these problems. Font size, weight and color causing accessibility issues in some sticker sizes. Moreover, it was difficult to define what characters to display in languages as chinese or japanese among others.

Sticker will be always image/icon based to avoid these problems.

Cards have been updated as a collateral effect.

**Form validation**

Form validation has been updated to reflect where alerts must appear on general form validation.

<time>January 2nd, 2019</time>
<p>New components</p>

We have new components to share with you:

-   [Color picker](../../core-components/forms/picker-color)
-   [Date and Time picker](../../core-components/forms/picker-date-time)

You will find them out soon in our Figma Library and in Clay.

<time>November 12th, 2018</time>
<p>General update</p>

-   Drag and drop pattern definition where you can find the styles and examples.
-   Resources: DEVCON 2018 presentation link and links to blog posts made by Lexicon Team.

<time>October 13th, 2018</time>
<p>General update</p>

**Examples:**

As promised, we are updating the examples section. This time we bring you an example from [Liferay Partner Portal](../../examples/partner-portal) submitted by Patrick Pentz.

**Dropdown menu:**

[Dropdown menu](../../core-components/dropdowns) definition has been updated to accept icons on the left side of actions.

**Tabs:**

[Tabs](../../core-components/tabs) have been updated with an example to give context in tab bars.

<time>October 12th, 2018</time>
<p>Management bar update</p>

We are happy to announce that we have a new update for the Management Toolbar. The Toolbar is now able to contextualize actions based on the selection in the dataset. This reduces the number of potential errors by narrowing the actions down to only the ones that are relevant to the selected elements.
Moreover, we introduce the results bar when filters are applied and/or search is performed from the Management Toolbar. This provides the user with useful and visible feedback.

<p>Examples</p>

Lexicon can be used to create many different interfaces. Today, we open a new "Examples" section in our site to showcase different Lexicon interface examples created by Liferay UX designers for our products. We hope these series of examples inspire you and give you an idea of the possible interfaces you can create. These examples will grow over time to showcase a wide variety of interfaces built with Lexicon.

<time>August 21st, 2018</time>
<p>New organization</p>

Components are now organized into two key groups: Core and Satellite.

-   **Core components** are the basic components that are widely used by Liferay products.
-   **Satellite components** are the remaining components that are not used that often in many Liferay products. Although these components are not as widely used, they can save you time from reinventing the wheel.

**Note:** that core components are implemented and supported by Clay, while satellite components are not supported.

We have also created a **Templates** section that includes the most common templates created with Lexicon components in Liferay products.

<p>Predictive Forecast Chart</p>

[Predicitive Forecast Chart](../../core-components/charts/chart-forecast) has been documented inside the charts section. This chart is very useful for commerce data.

<time>June 27th, 2018</time>
<p>Stable version</p>

We also want to highlight the improvements made since the last release:

-   The site has now uses the system font like we do in Lexicon.
-   All images have been changed from Source Sans Pro to San Francisco (system font for MacOS)
-   A large number of patterns now include attribute sections that describe the pattern's anatomy.
-   Examples have been added to many of our patterns, and the descriptions have been updated.

Moreover, now you can find our sketch library under [resources](../../resources) section to build your own interfaces using Lexicon.

<time>April 24th, 2018</time>
<p>Beta release</p>

We are glad to announce that we are in beta right now. We will update style changes before leaving beta status.

<time>April 20th, 2018</time>
<p>General Update</p>

This update comes with many small updates that improve communication:

-   Charts: base layer interaction and different chart examples
-   Forms: reorganized for better understanding
-   Animations: pending, but an introduction is there as reference
-   Labels: patterns have been labeled to specify if they are implemented by Clay or if they are owned by another team/application.
-   Status table: specifies the design and implementation status for each component's page

<time>January 17th, 2018</time>
<p>General Update</p>

This update comes with many small updates that improve communication:

-   Dos and Don'ts have been included for the following patterns: badges, labels, table, actions definition, and popover. This helps clarify the proper usage of each pattern.
-   Multiple step form now includes an example that demonstrates how to use the pattern.
-   Text input localizable has been released.
-   Card layout has been added to the Layout section under the Foundation heading.
-   Vertical navigation now includes an example of a collapsible menu on mobile.
-   Sidebar documentation has been organized into several areas of focus.

<time>January 8th, 2018</time>
<p>Examples</p>

Examples, along with images demonstrating the proper usage, have been added to the table page to clarify the row hover action. Multistep form has also been updated with a layout example in a form to better illustrate how to use it. Finally, checkbox group and radio group examples, along with metrics, have been added.

<time>January 3rd, 2018</time>
<p>Sites</p>

A full set of components is available in the [sites section](../../satellite-components/sites/overview) for you to use to build your own site widgets. This lets you transform old widgets, by bringing them new life with a better information architecture, structure, and a refreshing design.

<time>November 28th, 2017</time>
<p>Layouts and Form Hierarchy</p>

As part of the improvement in Lexicon, we want to clearly define the different layout possibilities that you'll usually find in admin pages. Layout is one of the foundation principles that is key to building interfaces with our system.

We've add a dedicated page for [form hierarchy](../../core-components/forms/forms-hierarchy) to better define the form pattern. The Forms section now also includes a [slider](../../core-components/forms/slider) section.

<time>November 20th, 2017</time>
<p>Charts and Sites</p>

Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage.

[Charts](../../core-components/charts/charts) are a completely new pattern in Lexicon. We want to provide a full set of principles for it to improve accessibility, perception, and interpretation.

[Sites](../../satellite-components/sites/overview) tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect, but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in the near future in this area as the next portal release date grows closer.

<time>November 13th, 2017</time>
<p>Updates</p>

Liferay is happy to announce a new alpha version of Lexicon. The alpha version brings a wider range of possibilities, new components, and a brand new color palette. Lexicon now focuses on accessibility, shorter interactions, and ways to achieve a better user experience never before seen in Liferay.

This alpha version will transition to beta as soon as Lexicon and Clay align.
