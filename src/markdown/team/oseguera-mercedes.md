### How did you get into design?

As long as I can remember, I’ve always loved fashion, art, shapes, colors, textures, papers, and creating new stuff with these elements. Although I knew I wanted to be a designer I also dreamt about being a doctor. After living in Paris for one year, I decided to study graphic design first and get to med school afterwards. (spoiler alert: med school didn’t happen — at least not yet).
