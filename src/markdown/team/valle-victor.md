I had the honor to serve this team and company for almost 6 years. Along this time I saw the team growing from a small piece inside Product division to have its own division where designers from different areas were a same unit, a unique team.

When I browse through my memories I find it full of annectodotes, funny moments, people that I love and people who made me better. Probably our trips to Los Angeles, our participations in different events such as Devcons or Symposiums are on the top of my memories. All I can say is that Liferay is a great place to work where you will feel really comfortable to put all your skills in action.

If you are a designer not yet in the team and thinking if this would be a good place for your career, please apply and join the team. This is a place were you will be heard, you will be respected, your ideas will be taken into consideration and where they will give you space to grow.

I keep this team in heart.

Thanks for everything ðŸ˜º
