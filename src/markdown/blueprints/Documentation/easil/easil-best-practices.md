### Selection

1. **Look for the right focal point.** Select photos with a focal point that won’t be completely blocked by the blue circle overlays. If using Blue Overlay 1-3, the focal point should be on the right. If using Blue Overlay 4-5, the focal point should NOT be in the center.
2. **Lighter backgrounds are better than darker ones.** The blue circles will show up better on mid- to light- toned photos with good contrast. When the circles overlay a dark background, they tend to look muddy.

### Cropping & Framing

1. **Try not to crop people at any joints** (knees, waist, elbows, toes, fingers, ankles, or wrists), as well as eyes and chin. Check out [this infographic](http://media.digitalcameraworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2012/03/Digital_Camera_World_portrait_photography_crop_guide1.png 'this infographic') for more details.
2. **Crop out distracting elements** on the edges wherever possible.

## Cobranded Logos

### Positioning

The Liferay logo is always on the left, and the partner logo on the right.

Keep the partner logo left-aligned to the pink box. This will ensure that the white divider line is evenly spaced between both logos.

### Visual Weight and Balance

The visual weight of a logo is determined by many factors, some of which include:

-   Font weight (bold, regular, light)
-   Length of word / number of characters
-   The amount of negative space vs. filled-in space
-   Number of colors (if not using a single-color version)

With these things in mind, adjust the size your partner logo so that it appears balanced in relation to the Liferay logo. This might mean making it slightly larger or smaller than the pink box.

### Examples

#### Vertical Logos

Since vertical logos are much shorter in length, we compensate by making them slightly larger than the pink box on top and bottom.

#### Too Large

Even though the text sizes seem similar, the Cat Nap logo is too large because the font is bold and has uppercase letters, whereas the Liferay logo has a lighter weight font and has mostly lowercase letters.
