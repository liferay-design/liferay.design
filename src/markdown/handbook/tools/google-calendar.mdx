## Create, Update, and Delete Guidelines

Before creating an event, ask yourself:

When creating an event:
-	Invite all attendees and mark those who can attend optionally
-	Add a Google Meet link
-	Add an agenda in the description

PTO + OOO:
-	Create an All Day event in your department calendar(s)
-	Naming convention is $Name PTO or $Name OOO
	-	Specify initial of last name or full last name if necessary
	-	E.g. Victor V PTO; Victor S OOO
-	You can specify AM or PM for when you are OOO as well if you are working a partial day
	-	E.g. Naoki OOO AM; 
-	Change event color to Graphite
-	[Create an Out of Office event](https://liferay.design/handbook/tools/google-calendar/#out-of-office) on your personal calendar as well
-	[Change your Slack status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qZFkacj6LQxmOqbM4IMpKZYCRxH5v-5X98xPFm97LU8/edit#heading=h.l8ngxecletqf) when you are out of office
