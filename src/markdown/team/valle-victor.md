### Favorite tool? ✏️

Spectacle, it is not a design tool, but it lets you organize windows in your desktop in a pretty easy way.

### Best lifehack? 🎈

Movie, low lights and... I get sleep in seconds.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing? 🔨

I've always wanted to be mathematician, probably influenced by my sister. But right now I don't see myself as a math teacher, I see myself as someone crafting and building things. I love the countryside, so I would be probably building wooden portable houses. At least I love these TV shows.

### Favorite place to visit? 🌳

Amazonas, I love animals. There is so much to discover there that I would go up and down the entire river several times.

### Favorite hotkey? 💻

`⌥⌘` + any arrow. Check Spectacle and you will understand me ;).

### Advice for ambitious designers? 👌

A sketch worths more than thousand words.

Divide and conquer! Apply this everywhere, it will reduce complexity to any problem or task you have.

### Last book you read? 📔

Tokyo Blues by _[Haruki Murakami](http://www.harukimurakami.com/author)_.

### Favorite superhero 💪

Well, I have several, but if I would have to choose one I'm sure to pick Kick-Ass.

### What keeps you up at night? 🌚

Slack! I'm kidding.

I like to plan trips, check where I can go hiking or scuva dive and plans related to nature.
