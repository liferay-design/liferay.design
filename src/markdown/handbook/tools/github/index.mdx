## Let's Git it Started

_This is written for people who generally try to avoid the terminal &mdash; it can be scary, but Liferay.Design is a lot like Zelda (you don't have to go alone ü•Å)!_

Any of the [designers here](https://github.com/orgs/liferay-design/people) can help you, or at least point you to someone who can.

**Set aside about 45 &mdash; 60 min to get set up.**

## Step 1: Create a Github Account _(3 min)_

1. [Set up a personal account](https://github.com/join)
1. Choose the "free" plan
1. Tailor your experience &mdash; if you'd like, this can be helpful

## Step 2: Join the Team! _(3 min)_

1. Look in your email for an invite to the Liferay Design GitHub Org &mdash; you should have received one from [Paul](/team/hanaoka-paul) or [Victor](/team/valle-victor). _If you didn't please reach out in the [#t-design-github](slack://user?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CMLT0TBH7) channel._
1. **Publicize your membership!** If you'd like Liferay Design to show up on your profile, we strongly encourage you to [follow GitHub's guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership).

## Step 3: Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) _(3 min)_

_It can be slightly inconvenient, but we strongly believe that the tradeoff is worth the extra security._

See [GitHub's guide to Configuring two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/configuring-two-factor-authentication) ‚Äî please don't hesitate to ask in [the channel](slack://user?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CMLT0TBH7) if you run into any issues!

## Step 4: Familiarize yourself with Git and Github _(20 min)_

1. Read [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and complete the tutorial. _(10 min)_
    - If you really, really, really aren't interested in this "technical" stuff, then this tutorial covers everything you'll need to create your bio page.
1. Read [Chris' post on Git Commit Messages](https://chris.beams.io/articles/git-commit/) &mdash; this will help you avoid Paul-like commit messages.
1. Read the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) _(10 min)_ for a good overview on the theory behind Git and GitHub.
    - **_NB_** This is important and helpful information to understand at a high level because Liferay uses Git.
1. Check out the [GitHub's resources](https://try.github.io/), and the [team's Trello cards](https://trello.com/b/500Ghgdu/development) on Git.
