We’ve hit a few bumps along the way but are constantly refining our process.

The social distancing took a toll on our job satisfaction and well-being, so we decided to create time where we could work together, virtually. Our daily office hours is a chance for the team to collaborate and/or work individually, while listening to music on Google Meet.

    content: |
        Debuting at Liferay’s 2020 Sales Kick-Off event in January, OPES (oh-pez), was launched as the king of global campaigns for the year. Positioning Liferay as a source of solutions, not products, the tagline highlights the unlimited ways in which Liferay’s singular platform can be used to help enterprises do business better. Our team created and developed the concept using origami to convey “many out of one”. We were excited to dream up all the fun, in-person promotions for the year — exhibitor booth activities, giveaways, mailers!

        We all know what happened to those plans in March. Alongside our marketers, we quickly adjusted to roll out 100% digital campaigns. Creating solution-specific ads for campaigns focused on e-commerce, digital workspace, and self-service portals. OPES visuals began as colorful, literal representations of origami playing off ad copy, and have evolved into more subtle, abstract backgrounds, highlighting the content. Who knows how OPES will evolve in 2021! Stay tuned.

    message:
        part1: |
            While 2020 has been a year of challenges and adaptations, we are reminded that difficult times are often opportunities for growth. The strength of this team is not in its collective design skillset, but rather in the enduring human bonds we have cultivated and nurtured over the years — not by luck or circumstance, but with mindful practice.

            Because of this, we’ve been able to rely on one another through our personal and professional journeys, time and time again. And now that we find ourselves in a global pandemic, we once again lean on each other. Our department’s ability to hold each other up throughout this year has made us stronger as people, as designers, and as a team.
        part2:
            title: What’s next?
            body: |
                If this year has shown us anything, it’s that we never really know what’s to come. We dream of great and ambitious endeavors, yet may be able to turn only a portion of it into reality. We’re moving in the right direction.

                Our product portfolio is becoming more cohesive, we're designing with more and more data, and — most importantly — our designers are growing and helping each other reach their full potential. It’s been a beautiful thing to see. As Liferay grows and adapts, I know we will continue to grow with it.
