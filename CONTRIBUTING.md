# Contributing to this site

We definitely appreciate contributions in any form &mdash; QA, [submitting issues](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/issues), providing feedback, code, design, etc.

If you're part of the Liferay team in Figma, there's a Liferay.Design project &mdash; you can see where we're at and contribute comments, designs, etc there.

If you'd like to help manage deployments, please request to join our WeDeploy team!

A good place to start is our [Issues page](https://github.com/liferay-design/liferay.design/issues)!
