## What is a Webinar request?

Request related to the creation of a specific webinar by the Communication Team.

### When to create a Webinar request?

Consider creating a Webinar ticket whenever there's a need to edit a pre-recorded webinar. Generally, webinar requests entail clipping footage, adjusting audio levels, and adding intros and outros. Webinar requests are not for requesting a recording. To request recording assistance, please reach out in our Slack channel ([#d-comm-des](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/CKETJ1DTR)) or [create a Communication Design Request](https://liferay.design/blueprints/jira/design-request/).
