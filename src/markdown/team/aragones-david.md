### How did you get into design?

I began many years ago using Aldus Photostyler, 3D Studio and other old-fashioned tools. However being honest. I was not aware of design until I read a Nielsen article talking about usability. At that moment I decided to drop out my studies of engineering and become a designer.

### Why are you at Liferay?

I believe when you're in a position to have gotten so much, the gift at this point is giving back to society. Liferay does it and I’m proud to be part of that.
