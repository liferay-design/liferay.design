## Role & Requirements

An exciting opportunity for an early-career designer, you’ll be working alongside a senior designer in the full SDLC (software development lifecycle) of a SaaS (software-as-a-service) product. As a product designer on Analytics Cloud, you will be influencing the design of a platform that helps businesses make data informed decisions. In this role you can expect to design for a wide range of aspects related to Analytics such data management, dashboarding, and machine learning.

Things you’ll need for success:

1. **Communication skills**: Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must.  We are an international company, so being comfortable communicating in English is required.
2. **Eagerness to work with others**: The AC team is highly collaborative — the ability to empathize, connect, and succeed with people who are different than you are is critical.
3. **Proficiency in modern design tools**: We use Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly so a track record of tool competency is helpful.


_You'll be mentored by a senior designer, so prior experience isn’t necessary, but some other things that would help you stand out:_

* Analytics background
* SaaS experience
