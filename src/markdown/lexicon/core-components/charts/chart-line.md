The points in a Line Chart are spaced apart (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. A Line Chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically.

Line Charts can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.
