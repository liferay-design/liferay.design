## Summary

-   Key Performance Indicators have a lot of influence over how teams prioritize, design and build features and products. Poorly defined KPIs could result in building a solution for the wrong problem which, in turn, dilutes a user’s experience with superficial engagement, leading to negative outcomes for the business.

Good design is not about higher CTRs (click-through-rates) or pageviews. It’s about delivering value to your business by serving your customers. Therefore, establish KPIs that align with the value you offer, instead of tracking superficial metrics.

## Takeaway

-   To set value-driven KPIs:

1.  Clearly define user goals before determining the metrics.
2.  Identify user behaviors that signal the defined goals.
3.  From those signals, select key signals to measure.

One thing to remember: Defining the value-driven KPIs is not a solo job for designers. Product managers, marketing teams, and stakeholders at all levels should work together to build products/services that provide customer value to build a better business.
