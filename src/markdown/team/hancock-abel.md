#### How did you get into design?

You don't "get into design". Design gets into your being and you can't help but find a way to practice it.


#### Favorite tool? 🛠

For design? Figma.

As a handy helper? [Clippy](https://clipy-app.com/). (Shoutout to Paul for the introduction)

For music? [Omnishpere.](https://www.spectrasonics.net/index.php) I have probably used it for every music project I worked on in the last four years. It's amazing.


#### Best lifehack? 🤹‍♂️

Don't buy stuff.

I love stuff and I have lots of stuff. But [they say](https://www.google.com/search?q=spend+money+on+experiences+not+things+research) that at the end of your life you will wish you had spent your time and money on experiences instead of stuff. For me, it's not always huge, dramatic experiences. It's little things fun things every week that I decide to spend money on without feeling guilty. I didn't come up with this philosophy but I definitely try to live by it. Keep a balanced perspective on what is important and how short life is.


#### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing? 🎶

Definitely writing & playing music! Currently I am working on music for a film and I hope to get to the point where I can do that full time. Then design on the side, along with woodworking/building.


#### What does your desktop/home screen look like? 💻

Right now, [this image](https://unsplash.com/photos/Mw2-KsA6PpY). It's a pretty weird picture but I love all the texture & rich color in it. There is also one folder. It's called Temp with 80 items in it that has been there for about a year hahah.


#### Favorite place to visit? 📍

Somewhere new! But if I'm not going somewhere new my favorite place is my hometown, [Boise, Idaho](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1235&bih=768&ei=CU2cW836N5PT8APj3ryAAQ&q=boise+idaho).


#### Favorite hotkey? 🔥🗝

Oh my gosh I love them all. I use hotkeys like crazy when working in Figma. My favorite right now might be `Shift + Enter`, which selects the parent layer of whatever element(s) you have selcted. Super simple but a huge time saver. 

Also `Control + Alt + Cmd` + `← or ↑` to center align or middle align elements.


#### Advice for ambitious designers? 💯

Be humble, but **don't underestimate your talent & passion**. Self-confidence can go a long way for anyone trying to be ambitious. 



#### Most effective productivity booster? 😴

Sleep. A tired designer is not a good designer.


#### What keeps you up at night? 🤷‍♂️

I sleep great! 


#### Shameless plug? 🎧
