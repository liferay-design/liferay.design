### How did you get into design?

I was working as an office boy in an advertising agency, and one friend who worked there invited me to study at a technical high school. I saw the opportunity to work in this agency and chose the advertising course. After one year, they invited me to work in the agency studio as an Art assistant, where I discovered Graphic Design as a fantastic field. Then I started my graduation in Industrial Design.
