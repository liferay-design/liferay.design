**Active**

#### Secondary button icon with text

This variation is an extension of Lexicon's secondary button, so it can be regular or have no borders.

**Default**

![Button site default and button site default borderless](/images/lexicon/sites/ButtonSitesDefault.jpg)

**Hover**

![Button site hover and button site hover borderless](/images/lexicon/sites/ButtonSitesHover.jpg)

**Active**

![Button site active and button site active borderless](/images/lexicon/sites/ButtonSitesActive.jpg)

These buttons are primarily used as triggers for actions and tools in the [Asset Toolbar](./assetToolbar).

#### Secondary blue buttons

This variation only appears for logged in users that have editing permissions for the corresponding portlet and its content. This button variation also extends Lexicon's secondary button and is identified by the distinctive blue color.

**Default**

![Button site default and button site default borderless](/images/lexicon/sites/ButtonSitesBlueDefault.jpg)

**Hover**

![Button site hover and button site hover borderless](/images/lexicon/sites/ButtonSitesBlueHover.jpg)

**Active**

![Button site active and button site active borderless](/images/lexicon/sites/ButtonSitesBlueActive.jpg)


When these buttons are associated with an asset, a blog entry, a knowledge base article, or a comment, they only appear when hovering over the associated item. See the [Asset Title Bar documentation](./assetTitleBar) for more information about this behavior.
