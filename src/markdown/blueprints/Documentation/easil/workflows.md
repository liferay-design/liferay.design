## Design Workflow

1. **Create:** Designers create templates, reviewing with marketers.
2. **Publish:** Templates are published to the ‘Team’ in Easil.
3. **Share:** Designers post template preview in **[#com-des-easil](slack://channel?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CM1HX3E95)**, notifying @here with tags (e.g. #twitter, #linkedin, #email).

## Marketing Workflow

1. **Create:** Marketer uses template to make a post.
2. **Publish:** Marketer schedules or posts on social media platform, then shares in [#com-des-easil](slack://channel?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CM1HX3E95) with tags (e.g. #twitter, #linkedin, #email) — no @here notification necessary, a Designer will review all things posted in the channel on a bi-weekly basis.
3. _\[if necessary\]_ **Revise:** if there are things that compromise the brand, make necessary revisions and update in the Slack thread.

## Review Workflow

1. **Ask** _(Marketer)_: If you’d like help or advice— post in [#com-des-easil](slack://channel?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CM1HX3E95), and @tag a designer.
2. **Review** _(Designer)_: Within 24 hours, review and provide actionable feedback.

## New Template Request

**Collaborate:** post your request in [#com-des-easil](slack://channel?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CM1HX3E95), tag #templateRequest
