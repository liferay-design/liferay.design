Navigation in a product can be present in differnet ways. It can show hierarchy, like a [breadcrumb](./breadcrumb) does. It can be present in menus, usually [vertically](./vertical-nav). Or even in dedicated [bars](./horizontal-nav) for navigation that at same time help spliting an application into smaller modules.
