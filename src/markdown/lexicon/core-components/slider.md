### Usage
Use a Slider when you need a selection from a range of values where we want the user to play with the possible values. A popular use is changing the contrast color value for an image. Other uses could be: setting the volume of audio, the reproduction bar of a video or adjusting a filter in a faceted search, etc.

A Slider shows a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. It has default values for its range: **min** to **max** — 0 to 100, each. However, these values can be tailored depending on what’s needed.

#### STEPS

Additionally, a step value can be set. A step specifies the size of each thumb movement (the increment or jump between values) of the Slider control.
Layout

### Layout

1.   **Progress**, this shows the value of the range selected. Can be transparent.
2.   **Thumb**, this is used as a knob to select a specific value from the range.  
3.   **Track**, this is the rail where the thumb moves. It represents the full range of values.

### Interaction

#### MOUSE

1. Once the thumb moves, it updates the slider value
2. A mouse click/tap on the track moves the thumb to that point in the track
3. If a step is defined, the click/tap moves the thumb to a step in the track.

**Tooltip**

It shows the current slider value. Showing the tooltip is optional as a slider can be combined with other components (inputs, labels, etc). It’s shown when the user hovers over the thumb.

**Drag and Drop**

The Thumb only moves horizontally so It can be dragged and dropped from right to left and left to right.
