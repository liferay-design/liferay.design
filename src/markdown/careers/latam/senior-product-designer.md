## Remote Friendly, Based in LATAM

_Establishing a strong design practice across Latin America is a high priority for our business. We’re looking for a senior designer with experience as a first-hire that can serve our customers and partners while simultaneously working with our existing team based in Brazil to continue cultivating a strong design culture there and beyond. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams in North America, Europe, and Asia that are excited to build with you._

## About This Position

Primarily, you’ll be working with one of our product teams working on our core platform, interfacing directly with prospects and customers along the complete software development lifecycle. Secondly, you’ll mentor junior designers based out of our Recife office, and lead the expansion of our design practice across more countries in Latin America.

Your first 90 days will be:

* Get to know the people, processes, and systems
* Onboard into multiple projects in various stages
* Add value with your perspective and experience leading projects in alignment with our design organization


### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

1. **Design leadership experience**: Contribute as an expert with deep knowledge in one or more product design verticals — and have experience leading people.
2. **Communication skills**: Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!
3. **Collaboration**: you can drive consensus and compromise without sacrificing business goals.

### Language Requirement:

* English: Conversational
* Portuguese: Fluent


## What do I need to apply?

1. Link to your website that includes case studies and work relevant to design operations
2. Cover letter: Brief note with feedback on [liferay.design/handbook](https://liferay.design/handbook/)

## Cover letter? Do you really read them?

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
