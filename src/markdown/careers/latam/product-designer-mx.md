**Remote in LATAM (Argentina / Brazil / Chile / Colombia / Mexico / Peru)**

_Establishing a strong design practice across Latin America is a high priority for our business. We’re looking for a senior designer with experience as a first-hire that can serve our customers and partners while simultaneously working with our existing teams based in the US and Brazil to continue cultivating a strong design culture there and beyond. While that sounds daunting, you won’t be doing it alone! We have a global design division with teams all over the world that are excited to build with you._

## About this position

Primarily, you’ll be working with one of our product teams working on our core platform, interfacing directly with prospects and customers along the complete software development lifecycle. Secondly, you’ll mentor designers across the experience spectrum, and lead the expansion of our design practice across more countries in Latin America.

Your first 90 days will be:

* Get to know the people, processes, and systems
* Onboard into multiple projects in various stages
* Add value with your perspective and experience leading projects in alignment with our design organization

### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

1. **Design leadership experience**: Contribute as an expert with deep knowledge in one or more product design verticals — and have experience leading people.
2. **Communication skills**: Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — excellent communication skills now more than ever, are a must. You’ll go far if you can demonstrate this!
3. **Proficiency with modern design tools and systems**: Our design system is in Figma — you don’t need to have experience with it, but you’ll need to learn it quickly, so a track record of tool and system competency is required.

### Language Requirement:

* English: Conversational
* Portuguese or Spanish: Fluent

### What can we offer you?

* Salary package commensurate with qualifications and experience (13 payments)
* Health insurance (100% coverage for you and 50% for your relatives)
* Life insurance
* Macbook Pro for personal and professional use
* 40 hours per year to volunteer at a nonprofit of your choice
* 22 working days of vacation
* Learning budget up to 16.920 MXN/year
* Room to assume responsibility and grow professionally
* Be part of a great team and work with designers around the world
* Work in a company that has strong executive support for Design

## What do I need to apply?

1. Portfolio link
2. In your cover letter (nothing formal), include a brief note with feedback on our brand

## Cover letter? Do you really read them?

Yes! It doesn't need to be formal — really all we're looking for is a brief response to the prompt.

_Note that applications sans cover letter are typically rejected post-haste._
