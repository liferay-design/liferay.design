### How did you get into design?

As a child I always enjoyed drawing everywhere, my favorite birthday gifts were the coloring books and colored pencils. Soon I realized I wanted to do something related to arts when I grew up.

### Favorite tool?

I'm discovering Sketch right now and I'm loving it, but definitely my all times favorite is InDesign.

### Best lifehack?

Drink more water!

### Where do you find #inspiration?

In all kind of visual expressions: photography, videos, movies, series, advertising, magazines, fashion, exhibitions... And it could be anywhere, on social media, Internet, TV or even on streets.

### If you weren't designing, what would you be doing?

I probably would be an Architect or an Interior Designer.

### What does your desktop/home screen look like?

For a long time it had been a turquoise water and white sand beach on a sunny day, just to keep connected with my island, Dominican Republic, specially on the winter days :0)

### Favorite place to visit?

I haven't been there yet, but I'm pretty sure Tokio will be a favorite.

### Favorite hotkey?

âŒ˜0. I love to see how everything is coming together.

### Advice for ambitious designers?

Always sketch on paper FIRST.

### Most effective productivity booster?

Put on your headphones, play your favorite song and pump up the volume!
