## Summary

Service Design is an interdisciplinary approach that combines a variety of methods and tools. Its characterizing principles are: user focus, creative cooperation, service sequencing, the need for documentation (visualization of the intangible) and a holistic approach. This field is still very new and evolving, hence it has quite a broad definition.

Service Design's goal is to tailor experiences accordingly based on customer needs. The principles of Design Thinking and Human-Centered Design directly reflect these ideas. Service design focuses on value proposition which could be delivered through digital or physical product or service.

## Takeaway

Good service design should consider both customer and business goals including ethical and environmental issues. Since AI & ML is raising many moral concerns, service design’s holistic approach will become ever more important.

Accordingly to the 'service sequencing' principle, it is good to compare our solutions to the following and preceding experiences and not only similar/ competitive products. With SD, remember it’s unimportant whether the experience is tangible or intangible, it aims to be memorable.
