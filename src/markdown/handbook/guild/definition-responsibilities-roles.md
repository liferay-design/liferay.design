## What is UX Design?

The design of interactive products and services, particularly concerns the way people interact with products and services.
UX Design can be understood in simple (but not simplified) terms: it is the design of the interaction between users and products. Most often when people talk about interaction design, the products tend to be software products like apps or websites. The goal of interaction design is to create products that enable the user to achieve their objective(s) in the best way possible.

Envisioning how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an UX Designer role, we’ll take on complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world—from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert.

Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of; Marketers, Communication/Brand Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.
