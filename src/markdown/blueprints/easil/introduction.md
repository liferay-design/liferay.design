To meet the growing demand for social media and email banner assets across our global offices, we’ve undertaken to streamline the design process by empowering marketers to create their own assets from Liferay-branded templates.

Enter [Easil](http://app.easil.com 'Easil'): it’s a powerful web-browser that app allows you to create social media and email graphics from Liferay-branded templates in a variety of export sizes.

## Online Training Course

1. Register for the online training course [Design Tool: Easil](https://educate.liferay.com/design-tool-easil 'Design Tool: Easil').
2. Go through all the course material (documentation, videos).
3. Take the quiz and submit it. **You must pass the quiz before you can receive an Easil invite.**
4. Fill out the Feedback Form and submit it.

## Approval & Set Up

1. Once you’ve completed the training course, request approval from your manager.
2. Once approved, go to the Slack channel [**#com-des-easil**](slack://channel?team=T03BTCQAJ&id=CM1HX3E95) and post an invite request with the following:
    - The hashtag **#easilAcces**
    - A confirmation of your manager’s approval (@mentioning your manager is enough)
3. An Easil invite will be sent to your Liferay account, and the link in the email will take you to the login page.
4. Create an account by filling in the right-side blanks and creating a password. **Do NOT use the “Register Using Google Account” button on the left.**
5. Once logged in, confirm that you can access the Liferay Team templates.
