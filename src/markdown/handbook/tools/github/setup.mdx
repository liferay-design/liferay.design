## Let's Git Set Up _(20 min)_

1. _(Optional)_ Visit our [Phresh-N-Clean](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean) guide &mdash; this whole thing is pretty helpful for setting up your computer in a way that it can quickly and easily be reformatted and restored will help your computer stay faster, better, longer. (So you can `work it`.)
1. Complete steps [1](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#1-homebrew-link), [2](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#2-node--npm-link), [4](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#4-homebrew-cask-link), and [6](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#6-git--github-link) of the [Set Up](https://github.com/liferay-design/phresh-n-clean#set-up) portion
1. Install a code editor â€” [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
    - `brew cask install sublime-text` or `brew cask isntall visual-studio-code`

## Clone the Repository _(2 min)_

1. Pat yourself on the back, you're almost done &mdash; the last thing to do is get a local copy (code on your computer) of the site repository (repo for short).
1. Orient yourself 1. Open your Terminal and type `ls` and hit Enter &mdash; this command will list the files and folders of the current directory (folder) 1. Type `open .` and hit Enter &mdash; this will open up Finder to the current directory. 1. Type `mkdir github` and hit Enter &mdash; now look at your Finder, you should now see a new folder labeled 'github' in your Home directory (`~/`) 1. Type `cd github` and hit Enter &mdash; you've now navigated to the github folder in your Terminal! - _Note that this is our suggested method for organizing your repos, feel free to organize differently._

    />

1. Now that your Terminal is open to your github folder, it's time to clone the repo!
1. Copy the url to your clipboard (there's a handy little button ðŸ“‹)
1. Type `git clone`, paste the repo url and hit Enter &mdash; cloning should take about 10 seconds.
1. Now you need to navigate to the folder &mdash; type `cd life` and hit Tab, it should autocomplete to `liferay.design` &mdash; if it does, hit enter, if not, finish typing it out
1. Take your fingers off the keyboard, and give yourself a hand, you're now ready to [begin development](#quick-start)!
