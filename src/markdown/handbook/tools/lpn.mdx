## What is lpn

_[Liferay Portal Nook (lpn)](https://mdelapenya.github.io/lpn/index.html), a fast and flexible CLI for managing Liferay Portal's Docker images._

## Why is it important
Lpn allows us going back to the past and check specific scenarios. Imagine you want to check previous versions to see the product evolution, or you just have to solve a bug in a certain product release. This tool will allow you making that in few minutes.

## Install lpn

<Image

/>

1.  [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
1.  Change docker preferences to have 6Gb memory
1.  Download the last [lpn](https://mdelapenya.github.io/lpn/releases.html) release (darwin64 if you are using a mac).
1.  You might need to rename your downloaded file to just 'lpn'.
1.  Open your terminal and go to where the file has been downloaded. By default Downloads folder.

    ```bash
    cd Download
    ```
1.  Move the file to bin folder

    ```bash
    mv lpn /usr/local/bin
    ```
1.  Go to that folder

    ```bash
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin
    ```
1.  By this point you should have lpn running in your computer. Now you can run images as shown in next section.
