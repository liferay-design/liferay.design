## Who Works Remotely?

_We are all, at some level, working remotely as a distributed team. That being said, most designers are working relatively close to one of our physical locations. Eschborn, Diamond Bar, Madrid, Milan, Recife, and more. **For the purposes of this policy — the word “remote” should be interpreted as “not in a local office”.**_

Flexible schedules are a perk of working at Liferay. We trust everyone that we hire — after all, if we can’t trust you to work when Juan isn’t over your shoulder, then we can’t trust you to work here at all.

### Fully Remote

We do not currently have any designers that are completely detached from a local Liferay office. As we continue to refine our policies and procedures, we hope to be able to open up positions for remote teammates in places where we do not yet have physical Liferay offices.

### Scheduled Remote Days

To regularly work remotely, a designer needs to be able to autonomously work effectively. Early-career designers should be completely onboarded and fully equipped before establishing regular home-office days and subject to manager and team-lead approval.

### Occasional Remote Days

Anyone on the team is encouraged to take a remote day on occasions when removing a commute would be helpful. For example, if your commute is typically more than 20 minutes and you have a dentist appointment that day — that’s a great reason to work at home.
