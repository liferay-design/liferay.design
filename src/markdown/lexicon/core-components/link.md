### Usage
* Only use links for navigation. A link must not trigger another kind of action.
* Do not use a link to trigger an action that could trigger a button. If you want to trigger a button, use a [button link](../buttons) instead.

### Types

#### Inline Link

Use an inline link when you need a link to flow naturally with a sentence or paragraph.

A single link is used for stand-alone hyperlinks. They can be text or an image.

#### External Link

Use external links to point to (target) external resources that are available on domains other than the current domain (source). Lexicon indicates this behavior with a tooltip.

For accessibility purposes, we also provide an icon to illustrate this behavior. This icon is visually hidden by default and only accessible on focus or when using assistive technologies such as screen readers.
