## About This Position

Providing design services to our customers by applying design best practices is a high priority for our business. We’re looking for a senior designer with agency experience that can serve our customers and partners. While you'll be leading your own project as a freelancer, you'll have opportunities to connect with other designers at Liferay! We have a global design division with teams in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific, and North America.

You’ll be working with our consulting teams, interfacing directly with prospects and customers in their discovery phase or along the complete software development lifecycle.

Sometimes you’ll work independently, guiding stakeholders along the entire design process from research and strategy to implementation, iterating along the way. Other times you'll work collaboratively with other designers to deliver the entire experience for customer projects.

Recent enterprise solutions this role has delivered for were customer and insurance agent portals, an employee intranet for a healthcare org, and a multi-site e-commerce solution for a major manufacturer.

## Who Are We Looking For?

### The top 3 things we’re looking for in a candidate:

1. **Experience facilitating design thinking workshops**

    User centered design is not only what we practice, but we are advisors to stakeholders and cross-functional team members on how to approach business and user problems with design thinking.

2. **Communication skills**

    Arguably one of the most important skills a designer can have — communication is both clearly articulating your design rationale while synthesizing stakeholders' input to achieve alignment and define the path forward.

3. **Leading projects end to end**

    Design Leads on projects need to be [T-shaped designers](https://chiefexecutive.net/ideo-ceo-tim-brown-t-shaped-stars-the-backbone-of-ideoaes-collaborative-culture__trashed/) that can deliver every step of the way from the discovery phase through designing mockups for implementation and development handoff to bring products to life.

### Other Qualifications

-   3+ years experience delivering end to end designs for products and not just sites
    -   Agency experience working with clients to manage expectations is ideal
-   Problem solving skills to translate complex business processes into streamlined user experiences
-   Owned or worked within design systems that you regularly contributed to and helped evolve
-   Experience leading a visual design direction for a new or redesigned product that accounts for accessibility requirements
-   Figma skills and experience for mockups, prototyping, components, design system, and Auto Layout.
-   Flexibility to work on projects based in either Pacific Standard Time or Eastern Standard Time
-   Availability to work on projects & engagements as short as 3 weeks or as long as 3-6 months.

## What will you be doing?

-   Lead various projects and engagements - ranging from discovery workshops, producing design concepts, to fully developed enterprise products
-   Collaborate with other designers as well as cross-functionally as a design consultant to our internal team of project managers and engineers and especially clients who often have no prior knowledge of design & UX.
-   Utilize and contribute robust patterns to our Figma component library

## What Can We Offer You?

-   Compensation based on an hourly rate commensurate with qualifications and experience.
-   Semi-flexible hours - there will be regular meetings with the client and team syncs, however there's flexibility of work hours outside of agreed meeting times.

## What Do I Need to Apply?

-   Tell us why you’re a fit for this freelance role
-   Resume or LinkedIn Profile
-   Portfolio link
