The kind of headline you write will depend on the type of collateral you’re creating or what channel it will be posted to. These are good general guidelines for writing effective headlines, but feel free to step outside of them if it will make your piece stronger.

-   Keep it short.
-   If it needs to be long, break it up with a colon (e.g., “Building for Today’s Customer: 6 Essential Web Strategies for Financial Services”).
-   Clear is better than clever. Research shows that simple, clear headlines lead to more clicks than punny headlines or plays-on-words.
-   Use “you” and “your” to make headlines more personal to readers. Headlines with questions work as well.
-   Always under promise and over deliver. No one likes headlines that over-hype the actual content (we call that click-bait).
